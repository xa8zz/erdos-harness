  keeps |A| = o(n) throughout the first K_n turns (one Prolonger reply
  per turn), deleted target sets on distinct turns are disjoint by

  true with T <= 8|S_0|/r(n) + O(1). (3) The proof stops exactly at
  J = 2: for S_1 = (n/4, n/2], a previously chosen a in (n/2, n] can
  satisfy d | a with a incomparable to an S_1 target x, killing the
  lower move d without killing x — external blockers absent from any
  rescaled smaller board destroy the uniform degree guarantee, and the
  refuted worst-case modulus (|M(A)| ~ n/log(1/alpha)) shows static
  completion cannot substitute the needed rate. The first genuinely
  unresolved case is J = 2, 0 < eta < 1; the repaired challenge is to
  prove FSC(J, eta) for all fixed J >= 2 (with a fixed prelude
  stopping rule and prefix-measurable tie-break) or disprove one
  explicit pair by forcing Omega(n) second-shell turns.
implications:
  - First fully proved nondegenerate instance of a live sufficient
    family in the program; the sufficiency pipeline plus FSC(1, eta)
    reduces the dichotomy's upper route to clearing shells 2..J.
  - The J = 2 obstruction is a concrete, minimal arena for the
    direct-ancestor channel: blockers in the SOLVED shell are the only
    thing standing between the greedy policy and the next shell.

# Verdict

The statement as written has a **degenerate parameter range**: whenever \(\eta\ge 1\), every phase is empty because \(Q_j(A)\subseteq S_j\). More substantively, the accepted degree-availability theorem proves the entire nondegenerate top-shell case:

\[
\boxed{\mathrm{FSC}(1,\eta)\text{ holds for every fixed }\eta>0.}
\]

In particular, this gives a full proof for the explicit nondegenerate pair

\[
\boxed{(J,\eta)=\left(1,\frac14\right).}
\]

The definitions and accepted degree-availability result used below are those in the uploaded record. 

This does **not** establish \(\mathrm{FSC}(J,\eta)\) for \(J\ge2\), so it does not prove \(L(n)=o(n)\).

## 1. The threshold-range collapse

For every position \(A\) and every shell \(S_j\),

\[
Q_j(A)\subseteq S_j,
\]

and hence

\[
|Q_j(A)|\le |S_j|.
\]

Therefore, if \(\eta\ge1\),

\[
|Q_j(A)|>\eta |S_j|
\]

is impossible. Every one of the \(J\) phases takes exactly zero Shortener turns. Thus

\[
\boxed{\mathrm{FSC}(J,\eta)\text{ holds vacuously for all fixed }J
       \text{ whenever }\eta\ge1.}
\]

The strict inequality in the activation condition means that \(\eta=1\) is already vacuous.

This is a genuine formulation collapse. The meaningful range is

\[
0<\eta<1.
\]

## 2. Nondegenerate theorem for the top shell

### Theorem

For every fixed \(0<\eta<1\),

\[
\mathrm{FSC}(1,\eta)
\]

holds uniformly against every Prolonger strategy. In fact, the trapping property itself is unnecessary here; only the fact that the prelude uses \(o(n)\) actual moves is needed.

### Proof

Write

\[
S_0=(n/2,n],
\qquad
Q_0(A)=S_0\cap\bigl(\mathcal L(A)\setminus\mathcal M(A)\bigr).
\]

Let \(A^{\mathrm{pre}}\) be the position at the end of the accepted trapping prelude. Uniformly against Prolonger,

\[
|A^{\mathrm{pre}}|=o(n).
\]

Fix \(0<\eta<1\). While the \(S_0\)-phase is active, we have

\[
|Q_0(A)|>\eta |S_0|.
\]

Since

\[
|S_0|=\left\lceil\frac n2\right\rceil,
\]

this implies, for all sufficiently large \(n\),

\[
|Q_0(A)|>\frac{\eta n}{2}.
\tag{1}
\]

Let

\[
R(A)=\mathcal L(A)\cap(n/2,n].
\]

Certainly \(Q_0(A)\subseteq R(A)\), so (1) gives

\[
|R(A)|\ge \frac{\eta n}{2}.
\tag{2}
\]

Apply the accepted degree-availability result with, say,

\[
\theta=\frac{\eta}{3}.
\]

It supplies a function \(r(n)\to\infty\) such that, at every position satisfying

\[
|A|=o(n),
\qquad
|R(A)|\ge\theta n,
\]

there is a currently legal lower move \(d\le n/2\) satisfying

\[
\deg_A(d)
=
\#\{u\in R(A):d\mid u\}
\ge
\bigl(2\theta-o(1)\bigr)r(n).
\]

Consequently, for all sufficiently large \(n\),

\[
\deg_A(d)\ge \frac{\eta}{2}r(n).
\tag{3}
\]

Every upper-half integer counted in \(\deg_A(d)\) lies in \(Q_0(A)\). Indeed, if \(u\in R(A)\), \(d\) is legal, and \(d\mid u\), then \(d<u\), so \(u\) has a legal proper divisor and is therefore nonminimal. Hence the move \(d\) deletes at least

\[
\frac{\eta}{2}r(n)
\]

members of the current \(Q_0(A)\).

The prescribed policy maximizes the number of deleted members of \(Q_0(A)\). It therefore deletes at least as many:

\[
\text{each active Shortener move deletes at least }
\frac{\eta}{2}r(n)
\text{ current }Q_0\text{-members}.
\tag{4}
\]

The only remaining point is to justify applying degree availability throughout the required interval without presupposing that the phase is sublinear.

Define

\[
K_n
=
\left\lfloor
\frac{2|S_0|}{\eta r(n)}
\right\rfloor+2.
\]

Because \(r(n)\to\infty\),

\[
K_n=O\!\left(\frac n{r(n)}\right)=o(n).
\tag{5}
\]

Suppose, for contradiction, that the phase lasts for at least \(K_n\) Shortener turns. Before any of those first \(K_n\) turns, the total number of selected integers is at most

\[
|A^{\mathrm{pre}}|+2K_n+1=o(n),
\]

because there is at most one intervening Prolonger move for each Shortener move. Thus all positions encountered during these first \(K_n\) turns satisfy the sparsity hypothesis \(|A|=o(n)\). Since the phase is still active, they also satisfy (1) and (2). Therefore (4) applies at every one of these turns.

Legal sets are monotone decreasing. In particular, a member deleted from \(Q_0\) can never later re-enter \(Q_0\). Hence the sets of targets counted as deleted on distinct Shortener turns are disjoint. The first \(K_n\) Shortener moves would therefore delete at least

\[
K_n\frac{\eta}{2}r(n)
>
|S_0|
\]

distinct members of \(S_0\), by the definition of \(K_n\). That is impossible because \(Q_0(A)\subseteq S_0\) at every time.

Consequently the phase takes fewer than \(K_n\) Shortener turns. By (5),

\[
T_{S_0}(n)=o(n),
\]

uniformly over every Prolonger strategy. This proves

\[
\boxed{\mathrm{FSC}(1,\eta)}
\]

for every fixed \(0<\eta<1\). Together with the vacuous \(\eta\ge1\) case, it holds for every fixed \(\eta>0\). \(\square\)

## 3. Explicit requested pair

Taking \(\eta=\tfrac14\), the proof gives the concrete uniform estimate

\[
T_{S_0}(n)
\le
\frac{8|S_0|}{r(n)}+O(1)
=
o(n).
\]

Thus

\[
\boxed{\mathrm{FSC}\!\left(1,\frac14\right)\text{ is true}.}
\]

Prolonger’s replies are fully arbitrary in this proof. They may directly delete shell targets, transfer them into the minimal legal set, block prospective lower moves, or play elsewhere. Any such action either helps terminate the phase or leaves the degree-availability argument applicable.

## 4. Why this proof stops exactly at \(J=1\)

The crucial implication was

\[
d\text{ legal},\quad u\in(n/2,n]\text{ legal},\quad d\mid u
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
u\in Q_0(A),
\]

combined with a degree theorem explicitly controlling the live upper half \(R(A)\).

For \(S_1=(n/4,n/2]\), the available upper-half theorem cannot simply be applied with \(n\) replaced by \(n/2\). A previously chosen \(a\in(n/2,n]\) may satisfy

\[
d\mid a,\qquad d\mid x,\qquad a\nmid x,\qquad x\nmid a,
\]

where \(x\in S_1\). Then \(a\) makes \(d\) illegal without making \(x\) illegal. Such external blockers are absent from the rescaled smaller-board position and can destroy the needed uniform degree guarantee.

The top-shell argument works because the accepted theorem supplies a rate \(r(n)\to\infty\) that remains valid over the whole \(O(n/r(n))\)-turn bootstrap interval. Static completion alone does not supply the analogous rate for \(S_1\): the refuted worst-case modulus permits

\[
|\mathcal M(A)|
\asymp
\frac{n}{\log(1/\alpha)}
\quad\text{when}\quad
|A|\asymp\alpha n,
\]

and then the accumulated minimal-cone deletion rate over a linearizing prefix can remain only \(O(n)\), not force an \(o(n)\) stopping time.

## 5. Exact repair of the challenge formulation

To exclude the two already-settled loopholes, the substantive challenge should read:

> Either prove \(\mathrm{FSC}(J,\eta)\) for every fixed \(J\ge2\) and every fixed \(0<\eta<1\), or disprove it for one explicit pair \(J\ge2\), \(0<\eta<1\), by forcing \(\Omega(n)\) Shortener turns.

For complete formal precision, it should also fix the trapping-prelude strategy and its stopping rule and either fix a prefix-measurable tie-break among maximum-deletion moves or quantify uniformly over every such tie-break.

The result proved here is therefore precise but limited:

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\mathrm{FSC}(J,\eta)\text{ is vacuous for }\eta\ge1,\\
&\mathrm{FSC}(1,\eta)\text{ holds for every }0<\eta<1,\\
&\text{the first genuinely unresolved case remains }J=2,\ 0<\eta<1.
\end{aligned}}
\]

It neither proves \(L(n)=o(n)\) nor provides a Prolonger construction forcing a linear game or a linear second-shell phase.
