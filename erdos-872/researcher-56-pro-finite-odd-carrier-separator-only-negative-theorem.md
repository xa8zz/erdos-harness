I am returning the permitted fallback outcome: a rigorous negative structural theorem for a precisely defined proof class. It does not determine the true order of L(n); it proves that one natural separator-only closure class cannot prove either O(r
1
	

(n)) or any other o(n) upper bound.

Let

U
n
	

=(n/2,n]∩Z,r
1
	

(n)=
logn
n(loglogn)
2
	

.

Call a proof method a finite odd-carrier separator-only closure if, for each large n, it chooses a finite set S
n
	

⊆[2,n/2] of odd integers such that

∣S
n
	

∣=o(r
1
	

(n)),

and, writing

P(S
n
	

)={p odd prime:p∣s for some s∈S
n
	

},

it has

H(S
n
	

):=
p∈P(S
n
	

)
∑
	

p
1
	

=o(1).

The closure is “separator-only” in the following precise sense: the only lower-half elements it is allowed to use to kill elements of U
n
	

 are Shortener-claimed elements of S
n
	

. Previously played elements of U
n
	

 may of course be removed individually, but the method has no composite fallback outside S
n
	

.

Theorem. No finite odd-carrier separator-only closure can prove L(n)=O(r
1
	

(n)). In fact, for every such S
n
	

, Prolonger has a legal play prefix of length o(r
1
	

(n)) after which every separator in S
n
	

 is dead, while at least

2
n
	

−o(n)

elements of U
n
	

 remain legal. Thus this proof class cannot prove any o(n) upper bound.

Proof.

Fix n and write S=S
n
	

, P=P(S). Suppose the current chosen set is an antichain A, every lower-half Shortener claim lies in S, and some s∈S is still legal.

Because s≤n/2, there is an integer a≥0 such that

2
n
	

<2
a
s≤n.

Indeed, choose a=⌊log
2
	

(n/s)⌋. Then 2
a
s≤n, and maximality of a gives 2
a+1
s>n, so 2
a
s>n/2.

Let

x=2
a
s∈U
n
	

.

I claim x is legal.

First, any previously chosen upper-half element y∈A∩U
n
	

 is incomparable with x, unless x=y. But two distinct integers in U
n
	

 cannot divide one another, since both exceed n/2. Also x

=y: if y=2
b
s
′
 was a previous preemption move with s
′
 odd, then equality 2
a
s=2
b
s
′
 forces s=s
′
, so s∣y, contradicting the assumption that s is still legal.

Second, let t∈A∖U
n
	

. By the definition of the technique class, t∈S, so t is odd and t≤n/2. Since x>n/2, we cannot have x∣t. If t∣x=2
a
s, then because t is odd, t∣s. But then t is comparable with s, contradicting the legality of s. Hence t∤x.

So x is legal. Prolonger may therefore play x, which makes s illegal forever, since s∣x.

Repeat this whenever a legal element of S remains. The set of legal future moves is monotone decreasing as the antichain grows, so killed separators never revive. Each Prolonger preemption kills at least one still-legal separator, and Shortener’s separator-only moves can only kill additional separators. Hence after at most ∣S∣ Prolonger moves and at most ∣S∣ Shortener moves, no element of S is legal. The prefix length is therefore at most

2∣S∣=o(r
1
	

(n)).

Now count legal upper-half integers after this prefix. Let A
U
	

=A∩U
n
	

. We have

∣A
U
	

∣≤∣S∣=o(n),

since r
1
	

(n)=o(n).

An upper-half integer u∈U
n
	

∖A
U
	

 can be illegal because of a lower-half separator only if some selected t∈S divides u. If t∣u, then u is divisible by at least one prime p∈P. Therefore the number of upper-half integers killed by lower-half separators is at most

	

p∈P
⋃
	

{u∈U
n
	

:p∣u}
	

≤
p∈P
∑
	

(
p
n
	

+1).

Since every p∈P divides some s≤n/2, we have p≤n, so 1≤n/p. Hence

p∈P
∑
	

(
p
n
	

+1)≤2n
p∈P
∑
	

p
1
	

=2nH(S)=o(n).

Thus at least

∣U
n
	

∣−∣A
U
	

∣−o(n)=
2
n
	

−o(n)

upper-half integers remain legal. This is ω(r
1
	

(n)), because r
1
	

(n)=o(n). Therefore no separator-only closure in this class can prove L(n)=O(r
1
	

(n)), or even L(n)=o(n). □

The packet separator methods in the prompt are a special case. Let

h=⌊loglogn⌋,Y=n
1/(2h)
,q
0
	

≤h/4,

and let P
n
	

⊆[Y,2Y] be a prime packet. Put

S
n
	

=
⎩
⎨
⎧
	

p∈Q
∏
	

p:Q⊆P
n
	

, 1≤∣Q∣≤q
0
	

⎭
⎬
⎫
	

.

For large n, all these separators are odd and

s≤(2Y)
q
0
	

=exp(q
0
	

(log2+logY))≤exp(
4
h
	

(log2+
2h
logn
	

))=n
1/8+o(1)
<n/2.

Also

∣S
n
	

∣≤
j≤q
0
	

∑
	

(
j
∣P
n
	

∣
	

)≤(q
0
	

+1)(2Y)
q
0
	

=n
1/8+o(1)
=o(r
1
	

(n)).

Finally, by the prime number theorem,

p∈P
n
	

∑
	

p
1
	

≤
Y
∣P
n
	

∣
	

≤
Y
π(2Y)−π(Y)
	

=O(
logY
1
	

)=O(
logn
h
	

)=o(1).

So the theorem applies to the single-packet finite-separator closure class.

Here is the Python sandbox verification of the finite antichain mechanics used above, plus the specific 91=7⋅13 legality phenomenon from the prompt.

The barrier is stronger than merely failing at r
1
	

: within this precisely defined separator-only class, the live upper-half space remains linear. Any successful O(r
1
	

(n)) upper-bound proof therefore has to use additional killing structure, such as a genuine composite fallback outside the finite odd-carrier separator layer.
