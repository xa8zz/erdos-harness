Scrutinized mathematical proof's logical rigor and numerical validityScrutinized mathematical proof's logical rigor and numerical validityI need to carefully audit this proof adversarially, examining each step of the argument that establishes the bound L(n)≤(0.22002...+o(1))nL(n) \le (0.22002... + o(1))n
L(n)≤(0.22002...+o(1))n for this combinatorial game. Let me start by understanding the core strategy: the Shortener plays the smallest legal odd prime for roughly K=n/((2λ+η)log⁡n)K = n/((2\lambda + \eta)\log n)
K=n/((2λ+η)logn) turns, generating an ordered sequence of primes q1<q2<...<qKq_1 < q_2 < ... < q_K
q1​<q2​<...<qK​.

The proof rests on four main pillars. First, there's a refined Chebyshev bound showing that if no odd prime up to some threshold QQ
Q is legal at step jj
j, then each such prime must divide either a previously played prime qiq_i
qi​ or one of Prolonger's moves. This gives the bound ϑ(Q)≤jlog⁡n+∑i<jlog⁡qi\vartheta(Q) \le j \log n + \sum_{i<j} \log q_i
ϑ(Q)≤jlogn+∑i<j​logqi​, which feeds into an inductive argument that qj≤(1+ε)j(log⁡n+log⁡j+O(log⁡log⁡n))q_j \le (1+\varepsilon)j(\log n + \log j + O(\log\log n))
qj​≤(1+ε)j(logn+logj+O(loglogn)). Second, a monotone replacement lemma allows us to compare the actual primes played against a model sequence of "ideal" primes bjb_j
bj​. Third, the proof uses a sieve argument based on factorial moments of uniformly random odd integers up to nn
n to estimate the probability that a certain random variable equals zero. Finally, these pieces combine to show that L(n)≤V2n+o(n)L(n) \le \frac{\mathcal{V}}{2}n + o(n)
L(n)≤2V​n+o(n) where V=∑r(−1)rIr\mathcal{V} = \sum_r (-1)^r I_r
V=∑r​(−1)rIr​ is a weighted sum of factorial moment terms. So log⁡(log⁡n+log⁡i+Clog⁡log⁡n)\log(\log n + \log i + C\log\log n)
log(logn+logi+Cloglogn) simplifies to log⁡log⁡n+O(1)\log\log n + O(1)
loglogn+O(1) since the dominant term is log⁡n\log n
logn. This gives me log⁡qi≤log⁡i+O(log⁡log⁡n)\log q_i \le \log i + O(\log\log n)
logqi​≤logi+O(loglogn). Summing over all pairs, I get ∑i<jlog⁡qi≤jlog⁡j+O(jlog⁡log⁡n)\sum_{i<j} \log q_i \le j\log j + O(j\log\log n)
∑i<j​logqi​≤jlogj+O(jloglogn), which means ϑ(Q)≤jlog⁡n+jlog⁡j+O(jlog⁡log⁡n)\vartheta(Q) \le j\log n + j\log j + O(j\log\log n)
ϑ(Q)≤jlogn+jlogj+O(jloglogn).

Now I'm setting Q=(1+ε)j(log⁡n+log⁡j+Clog⁡log⁡n)Q = (1+\varepsilon) j(\log n + \log j + C\log\log n)
Q=(1+ε)j(logn+logj+Cloglogn) and checking whether this upper bound is satisfied. The difference between what I need and what I have is εj(log⁡n+log⁡j)\varepsilon j(\log n + \log j)
εj(logn+logj) plus the log⁡log⁡n\log\log n
loglogn terms, so I need the constant CC
C to be large enough that (1+ε)C(1+\varepsilon)C
(1+ε)C dominates the implicit constant in the O(⋅)O(\cdot)
O(⋅) term.

The key question is whether CC
C can be chosen uniformly across all values of nn
n and ii
i. When I expand the logarithm, the correction term log⁡(1+log⁡i/log⁡n+Clog⁡log⁡n/log⁡n)\log(1 + \log i / \log n + C\log\log n/\log n)
log(1+logi/logn+Cloglogn/logn) stays bounded by O(1)O(1)
O(1) for i≤Ki \le K
i≤K, giving me log⁡log⁡n+O(1)\log\log n + O(1)
loglogn+O(1). But the Chebyshev bound introduces an error term O(Q/log⁡Q)O(Q/\log Q)
O(Q/logQ) that could be problematic—as QQ
Q ranges up to nn
n, this error might not be uniformly small relative to the main term.

Actually, Chebyshev's bound gives ϑ(Q)∼Q\vartheta(Q) \sim Q
ϑ(Q)∼Q asymptotically, so for sufficiently large QQ
Q I can guarantee ϑ(Q)≥(1−η)Q\vartheta(Q) \ge (1-\eta)Q
ϑ(Q)≥(1−η)Q for any η>0\eta > 0
η>0. The strategy is to assume no prime ≤Q\le Q
≤Q is legal, which would imply ϑ(Q)\vartheta(Q)
ϑ(Q) is bounded by the right-hand side, and derive a contradiction using this lower bound.

Now I'm working through the algebra with the specific form of QQ
Q in terms of jj
j and nn
n. The key is checking whether (1+ε)(1−η)>1(1+\varepsilon)(1-\eta) > 1
(1+ε)(1−η)>1 plus the error terms, which depends on how jj
j scales relative to nn
n—for small jj
j the error is manageable, but as jj
j approaches n/log⁡nn/\log n
n/logn the logarithmic terms become comparable and the error term grows.

For the base case where j=1j = 1
j=1, I need to verify that the smallest available odd prime fits within the bound (1+ε)(log⁡n+Clog⁡log⁡n)(1+\varepsilon)(\log n + C\log\log n)
(1+ε)(logn+Cloglogn), which follows from standard prime gap results.

The main concern is ensuring the O(log⁡log⁡n)O(\log\log n)
O(loglogn) error terms propagate correctly through the induction—the implicit constants need to be absorbed into CC
C consistently. The argument itself is sound, though the Chebyshev bound ϑ(Q)∼Q\vartheta(Q) \sim Q
ϑ(Q)∼Q requires QQ
Q to be sufficiently large.

Since we're taking jj
j up to roughly n/log⁡nn/\log n
n/logn, this pushes QQ
Q up to around nn
n. The Prime Number Theorem gives us ϑ(Q)=Q+O(Qe−clog⁡Q)\vartheta(Q) = Q + O(Q e^{-c\sqrt{\log Q}})
ϑ(Q)=Q+O(Qe−clogQ​), which is uniformly (1+o(1))Q(1+o(1))Q
(1+o(1))Q for any QQ
Q larger than a fixed constant, so this works out. ✓

Now for the monotone replacement lemma: I need to show that among odd integers coprime to RR
R and at most nn
n, the count of multiples of qq
q behaves nicely under the injection.

The map sends m=qam = qa
m=qa to papa
pa where p<qp < q
p<q and neither divides RR
R. For this to work, I need papa
pa to stay in our set and be divisible by pp
p. Since mm
m is odd and qq
q is odd, aa
a must be odd, which makes papa
pa odd too. The constraint m=qa≤nm = qa \le n
m=qa≤n with p<qp < q
p<q ensures pa<npa < n
pa<n as well.

For coprimality with RR
R: since p∉Rp \notin R
p∈/R and q∉Rq \notin R
q∈/R, both are coprime to RR
R. If (qa,R)=1(qa, R) = 1
(qa,R)=1, then (a,R)=1(a, R) = 1
(a,R)=1 follows immediately. The map is injective since pa1=pa2pa_1 = pa_2
pa1​=pa2​ forces a1=a2a_1 = a_2
a1​=a2​. Now I need to verify that the image actually consists of elements divisible by pp
p in our set.

Actually, I'm realizing the target set includes all multiples of pp
p in SRS_R
SR​, not just those avoiding qq
q. So the injection from multiples of qq
q to multiples of pp
p gives us a cardinality bound: the number of qq
q-multiples in SRS_R
SR​ is at most the number of pp
p-multiples. Using inclusion-exclusion, I can express ∣SR∪{p}∣|S_{R \cup \{p\}}|
∣SR∪{p}​∣ in terms of these counts.

Since ∣SR∪{p}∣=∣SR∣−∣{m∈SR:p∣m}∣|S_{R \cup \{p\}}| = |S_R| - |\{m \in S_R: p|m\}|
∣SR∪{p}​∣=∣SR​∣−∣{m∈SR​:p∣m}∣ and similarly for qq
q, and we've shown the qq
q-multiples are fewer, replacing qq
q with a larger prime pp
p actually increases the survivor count. This means I can bound the survivors of smaller primes using larger ones, which helps establish an upper bound on the antichain size by working with the larger prime set instead.

Now I need to verify that replacing primes one-at-a-time preserves the structure. Starting with R0={q1,...,qK}R_0 = \{q_1, ..., q_K\}
R0​={q1​,...,qK​}, I remove q1q_1
q1​ to get R={q2,...,qK}R = \{q_2, ..., q_K\}
R={q2​,...,qK​}, then apply the replacement with p=q1p = q_1
p=q1​ and q=b1q = b_1
q=b1​. For this to work, both q1q_1
q1​ and b1b_1
b1​ must be outside RR
R—q1q_1
q1​ is clearly not in RR
R, but I need to ensure b1b_1
b1​ doesn't equal any of q2,...,qKq_2, ..., q_K
q2​,...,qK​.

This could be problematic if b1b_1
b1​ happens to coincide with one of the original primes. I could sidestep this by constructing the bjb_j
bj​ values to avoid the original set, or if there's a collision, I could shift to the next available prime. But looking at how the model sequence is built from larger primes, I'm not immediately certain all bjb_j
bj​ exceed qKq_K
qK​, so I need to reconsider the construction more carefully.

The researcher's approach is to ignore the first J=⌈nδ⌉J = \lceil n^\delta \rceil
J=⌈nδ⌉ primes and then compare qjq_j
qj​ to a model sequence bjb_j
bj​ of larger primes for j>Jj > J
j>J. The issue is that while bj>qjb_j > q_j
bj​>qj​ by design, there's still potential overlap with other qiq_i
qi​ values. The fix would be to choose the bjb_j
bj​ from primes larger than qKq_K
qK​, but that constrains them to a specific range determined by the measure formula, which creates tension with the requirement that bjb_j
bj​ follow the asymptotic form (λ+o(1))jlog⁡n(1+uj)(\lambda + o(1)) j \log n (1+u_j)
(λ+o(1))jlogn(1+uj​). I need to think through whether this constraint can actually be satisfied. researcher picks bjb_j
bj​ to be primes of the form (λ+o(1))j(log⁡n+log⁡j)(\lambda + o(1)) j(\log n + \log j)
(λ+o(1))j(logn+logj). If λ>1\lambda > 1
λ>1 is chosen slightly larger than 11
1, then for j>J=nδj > J = n^\delta
j>J=nδ, b_j > $ the true Chebyshev bound $(1+\varepsilon)j(\log n + \log j + O(\log\log n))
 for ε\varepsilon
ε small enough. So bj>qjb_j > q_j
bj​>qj​.

Now, can bj=qib_j = q_i
bj​=qi​ for i≠ji \neq j
i=j? Since qiq_i
qi​'s are specific primes that Shortener plays, and bjb_j
bj​'s are a different sequence. In principle they can overlap.

Real fix: We can sidestep this by noting that the set {bj:J<j≤K}\{b_j : J < j \le K\}
{bj​:J<j≤K} can be perturbed to avoid the first JJ
J primes that Shortener chose. Since we have freedom in constructing the bjb_j
bj​ sequence, we can ensure they're distinct from q1,...,qJq_1, ..., q_J
q1​,...,qJ​, while the remaining qiq_i
qi​'s don't appear in our set R={bJ+1,...,bK}R = \{b_{J+1}, ..., b_K\}
R={bJ+1​,...,bK​} anyway.

Now I'm reconsidering the structure of the problem. To bound N(q1,...,qK)N(q_1, ..., q_K)
N(q1​,...,qK​), I can drop the first JJ
J primes and work with N(qJ+1,...,qK)N(q_{J+1}, ..., q_K)
N(qJ+1​,...,qK​) instead, which gives a lower bound on the original quantity. I can ensure the replacement primes are distinct from the remaining original ones by carefully choosing values near the target—the prime number theorem guarantees enough options in any reasonable range. Now I'm working through the log-scale measure convergence, where for each replacement prime bjb_j
bj​ corresponding to position u=log⁡j/log⁡nu = \log j / \log n
u=logj/logn, I need to verify the asymptotic behavior of the logarithmic expressions involved. Now I'm converting this to an integral by substituting j=nuj = n^u
j=nu, which transforms the sum over jj
j into an integral over uu
u. After working through the change of variables, the sum ∑p∈B1/p\sum_{p \in B} 1/p
∑p∈B​1/p evaluates to approximately (1/λ)log⁡(2/(1+δ))(1/\lambda) \log(2/(1+\delta))
(1/λ)log(2/(1+δ)), which approaches (1/λ)log⁡2(1/\lambda)\log 2
(1/λ)log2 as δ\delta
δ vanishes—and this result seems consistent with what I'd expect.

For the inclusion-exclusion step, since each prime in Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​ is at least nδn^\delta
nδ, any integer M≤nM \le n
M≤n can have at most ⌊1/δ⌋\lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor
⌊1/δ⌋ prime factors from this set, so the inclusion-exclusion formula terminates exactly at that bound rather than extending infinitely.

Now I'm looking at the factorial moments of XX
X. The key is computing E(Xr)\mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
E(rX​) as a sum over all rr
r-tuples of distinct primes from Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​, where each term is the probability that their product divides MM
M. For MM
M chosen uniformly from odd integers in a given range, the divisibility probability depends on counting how many odd multiples of each prime (or product of primes) fall within that range, then normalizing by the total count of odd integers. odd, # odd multiples of p1⋯prp_1 \cdots p_r
p1​⋯pr​ in [1,n][1, n]
[1,n] is about n/(2p1⋯pr)n/(2 p_1 \cdots p_r)
n/(2p1​⋯pr​). Total odd integers: n/2n/2
n/2. So P(p1⋯pr∣M)≈1/(p1⋯pr)\mathbb{P}(p_1 \cdots p_r | M) \approx 1/(p_1 \cdots p_r)
P(p1​⋯pr​∣M)≈1/(p1​⋯pr​).

Restriction: p1⋯pr∣M≤np_1 \cdots p_r | M \le n
p1​⋯pr​∣M≤n requires p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n. So we restrict to p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n, i.e., log⁡p1+...+log⁡pr≤log⁡n\log p_1 + ... + \log p_r \le \log n
logp1​+...+logpr​≤logn, i.e., u1+...+ur≤1u_1 + ... + u_r \le 1
u1​+...+ur​≤1 (where ui=log⁡pi/log⁡nu_i = \log p_i / \log n
ui​=logpi​/logn).

The expected value of the binomial coefficient works out to a sum over all valid prime tuples, which I can convert to an integral by treating the logarithmic variables as continuous. Each individual sum over primes converges to an integral involving the density function, and the rr
r-fold product gives me the full integral over the constrained region.

I need to verify the ordering is handled correctly—since I'm summing over ordered tuples (p1,...,pr)(p_1, ..., p_r)
(p1​,...,pr​) with p1<...<prp_1 < ... < p_r
p1​<...<pr​, that's one specific ordering out of r!r!
r! possible orderings, so the integral naturally includes the factor of 1/r!1/r!
1/r! to account for this. The constraint that u1+...+ur≤1u_1 + ... + u_r \le 1
u1​+...+ur​≤1 comes from requiring the product of primes to stay below nn
n.

Now checking whether the error terms vanish uniformly: since rr
r is bounded by 1/δ1/\delta
1/δ (which is fixed), I only have finitely many values of rr
r to consider, so uniformity is guaranteed.

For the order of limits, I'm looking at how Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda, \delta}
Vλ,δ​ behaves as both δ\delta
δ and λ\lambda
λ approach their limits. As δ\delta
δ shrinks to zero, the constraint on the uiu_i
ui​ variables expands and the sum extends to infinitely many terms. Meanwhile, as λ\lambda
λ approaches 1, the measure simplifies toward the standard form.

The key insight is that the integrand is uniformly bounded—each term is at most 1/(r!)21/(r!)^2
1/(r!)2—and the series converges absolutely. This means the function is continuous in both parameters, so I can interchange the order of taking limits without affecting the final result. By dominated convergence, whether I let δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0 first or λ→1\lambda \to 1
λ→1 first, I arrive at the same value V\mathcal{V}
V.

Now I'm computing the first few terms numerically to verify the formula. I0I_0
I0​ is trivially 1, and I1I_1
I1​ gives log⁡2\log 2
log2. For I2I_2
I2​, I'm setting up the double integral over the simplex and working through the substitution to evaluate it. Continuing with the numerical evaluation, I'm getting approximately 0.2955 for that integral using Simpson's rule, which gives I2≈0.1478I_2 \approx 0.1478
I2​≈0.1478—pretty close to the researcher's value of 0.1472. Now let me verify this more rigorously by examining the integrand's behavior across the interval.

I'm computing the function values at regular steps from 0 to 1 and applying the trapezoidal rule with finer granularity. The sum works out to about 0.2950, confirming I2≈0.1475I_2 \approx 0.1475
I2​≈0.1475. Plugging everything back into the formula for V\mathcal{V}
V, I get approximately 0.4404, which means κ≈0.2202\kappa \approx 0.2202
κ≈0.2202—matching the researcher's claimed value of 0.22002 quite well.

Now I need to verify the Leibniz alternating series bound by checking whether Ir>Ir+1I_r > I_{r+1}
Ir​>Ir+1​. I'm setting up the integral representations for consecutive terms and planning to integrate out the extra variable to establish the inequality. for fixed (u1,...,ur)(u_1, ..., u_r)
(u1​,...,ur​) with ∑ui≤1\sum u_i \le 1
∑ui​≤1, ∫01−∑uidur+1/(1+ur+1)=log⁡(2−∑ui)\int_0^{1 - \sum u_i} du_{r+1}/(1+u_{r+1}) = \log(2 - \sum u_i)
∫01−∑ui​​dur+1​/(1+ur+1​)=log(2−∑ui​).

Now I can express Ir+1I_{r+1}
Ir+1​ as an integral over the simplex with the logarithmic term. Since the sum of the uiu_i
ui​ is bounded by 1, the logarithm stays between 0 and log⁡2\log 2
log2, which lets me bound the entire integral by log⁡2(r+1)!\frac{\log 2}{(r+1)!}
(r+1)!log2​ times the integral of the product terms.

This integral turns out to equal log⁡2r+1⋅Ir\frac{\log 2}{r+1} \cdot I_r
r+1log2​⋅Ir​, which is strictly less than IrI_r
Ir​, confirming the alternating series converges.

Now I need to verify the overall argument actually works—checking whether the bound on the antichain size is correct and whether all the pieces fit together.
I'm realizing there's a subtle issue with how I'm counting: the antichain size ∣A∣|A|
∣A∣ should equal the total number of moves in the game, which is L(n)L(n)
L(n). Let me make sure I'm interpreting the bound correctly—it says ∣A∣|A|
∣A∣ is at most KK
K plus the count of odd integers up to nn
n that are coprime to all the qjq_j
qj​ values. We have KK
K Shortener moves in the prefix (plus some Prolonger moves we haven't counted). After the prefix, Shortener may make more moves, Prolonger may make more moves.

Actually, the strategy is: Shortener plays smallest-legal-odd-prime for KK
K turns. Prolonger plays whatever he wants. Both players continue to play until the antichain is maximal.

So ∣A∣|A|
∣A∣ includes KK
K of Shortener's prefix moves, plus all of Prolonger's moves, plus any remaining Shortener moves.

The bound ∣A∣≤K+N(q1,...,qK)|A| \le K + N(q_1, ..., q_K)
∣A∣≤K+N(q1​,...,qK​) is justified as follows: the KK
K Shortener prefix moves are q1,...,qKq_1, ..., q_K
q1​,...,qK​, and other elements of AA
A must be odd integers that don't get divisible by any qjq_j
qj​ in the antichain, since the compression map ϕ(x)=x/2v2(x)\phi(x) = x / 2^{v_2(x)}
ϕ(x)=x/2v2​(x) is injective on antichains and preserves the antichain property under divisibility constraints. ains the odd parts of all elements of AA
A. In particular, it contains ϕ(qj)=qj\phi(q_j) = q_j
ϕ(qj​)=qj​ for j≤Kj \le K
j≤K.

For any other x∈Ax \in A
x∈A: ϕ(x)\phi(x)
ϕ(x) is some odd number. If qj∣ϕ(x)q_j | \phi(x)
qj​∣ϕ(x), then qj∣xq_j | x
qj​∣x (since qjq_j
qj​ is odd), so qj∣xq_j | x
qj​∣x and qj≠xq_j \neq x
qj​=x means either qj<xq_j < x
qj​<x (so qj∣xq_j | x
qj​∣x and qj,xq_j, x
qj​,x both in AA
A with qj∣xq_j | x
qj​∣x — contradiction, antichain) or x<qjx < q_j
x<qj​ (impossible if qj∣xq_j | x
qj​∣x unless x=qjx = q_j
x=qj​).

So for elements outside DD
D, their images under ϕ\phi
ϕ are odd integers not divisible by any qjq_j
qj​, while DD
D maps to exactly q1,...,qKq_1, ..., q_K
q1​,...,qK​. This means ∣A∣≤K|A| \le K
∣A∣≤K plus the count of odd numbers up to nn
n avoiding all the qjq_j
qj​'s, which gives me ∣A∣≤K+N(q1,...,qK)|A| \le K + N(q_1, ..., q_K)
∣A∣≤K+N(q1​,...,qK​). Using sieve bounds to estimate NN
N as roughly (1/2)V⋅n(1/2)\mathcal{V} \cdot n
(1/2)V⋅n, I get ∣A∣≤(V/2)n+o(n)|A| \le (\mathcal{V}/2)n + o(n)
∣A∣≤(V/2)n+o(n).

But wait—I need to reconsider whether Shortener's strategy actually works the way I'm assuming. So the bound holds: L(n)≤(V/2)n+o(n)L(n) \le (\mathcal{V}/2)n + o(n)
L(n)≤(V/2)n+o(n) under Shortener's strategy. But I need to check whether the game actually lasts long enough for Shortener to execute this strategy—if Prolonger doesn't generate enough moves, the game could end prematurely and invalidate the argument.

Since Prolonger and Shortener alternate with Prolonger going first, the total moves satisfy ∣A∣=2S|A| = 2S
∣A∣=2S or 2S+12S+1
2S+1 where SS
S is Shortener's move count. For Shortener to play all KK
K prefix moves, we need ∣A∣≥2K|A| \ge 2K
∣A∣≥2K. If the game is shorter than that, then ∣A∣<2K|A| < 2K
∣A∣<2K already gives a weak bound, but if ∣A∣≥2K|A| \ge 2K
∣A∣≥2K, Shortener executes her full strategy and the analysis applies.

After Shortener plays her KK
K prefix moves q1,…,qKq_1, \ldots, q_K
q1​,…,qK​, the bound ∣A∣≤K+N(q1,…,qK)|A| \le K + N(q_1, \ldots, q_K)
∣A∣≤K+N(q1​,…,qK​) holds because every element of AA
A compresses to a distinct odd integer at most nn
n, which includes the KK
K primes she chose plus the remaining odd integers not divisible by any of them.

The key insight is that this bound applies at any point in the game, including the end. If the game ends before Shortener completes KK
K moves, I just use the actual number K′K'
K′ of primes she played instead, giving ∣A∣≤K′+N(q1,…,qK′)|A| \le K' + N(q_1, \ldots, q_{K'})
∣A∣≤K′+N(q1​,…,qK′​), which still works since NN
N is monotone in the set of primes. this case the bound holds trivially. When Shortener plays at least KK
K prefix moves, I need to recompute the bound on NN
N more carefully. I have N(Bλ,δ)≤(Vλ,δ+o(1))⋅n/2N(B_{\lambda,\delta}) \le (\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta} + o(1)) \cdot n/2
N(Bλ,δ​)≤(Vλ,δ​+o(1))⋅n/2, which gives me ∣A∣≤K+N|A| \le K + N
∣A∣≤K+N bounded by the desired threshold.

As δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0 and λ→1\lambda \to 1
λ→1, this converges to V⋅n/2\mathcal{V} \cdot n/2
V⋅n/2, so I'm getting ∣A∣≤K+(V/2+o(1))n/2⋅2|A| \le K + (\mathcal{V}/2 + o(1)) n/2 \cdot 2
∣A∣≤K+(V/2+o(1))n/2⋅2. Let me verify the scaling once more—I have N/(n/2)→VN/(n/2) \to \mathcal{V}
N/(n/2)→V, which means...

Actually, this simplifies to ∣A∣≤K+(V/2+o(1))n|A| \le K + (\mathcal{V}/2 + o(1))n
∣A∣≤K+(V/2+o(1))n, and since KK
K is dominated by the linear term, the bound is essentially L(n)≤(V/2+o(1))n≈0.22nL(n) \le (\mathcal{V}/2 + o(1))n \approx 0.22n
L(n)≤(V/2+o(1))n≈0.22n with V≈0.44\mathcal{V} \approx 0.44
V≈0.44.

Now I need to think through the adversarial audit more carefully, particularly how Lemma 2 handles the one-at-a-time replacement of the qq
q values with the bb
b values.

Starting with the set R0={qJ+1,...,qK}R_0 = \{q_{J+1}, ..., q_K\}
R0​={qJ+1​,...,qK​}, I'm replacing elements sequentially—first swapping qJ+1q_{J+1}
qJ+1​ for bJ+1b_{J+1}
bJ+1​ to get R1R_1
R1​, then continuing this process. For Lemma 2 to apply at each step, I need both the element being removed and the element being added to be outside the remaining set, which holds since the qq
q values are distinct from each other and the bb
b values are being introduced fresh.

Now I'm checking whether bJ+1b_{J+1}
bJ+1​ actually differs from all the later qjq_j
qj​ values. Using the bounds from Lemma 1 on the qjq_j
qj​ and the construction of bjb_j
bj​ with parameter λ=1+2ε\lambda = 1 + 2\varepsilon
λ=1+2ε, I can see that bJ+1b_{J+1}
bJ+1​ grows roughly like (1+2ε)(J+1)(log⁡n+log⁡(J+1))(1+2\varepsilon)(J+1)(\log n + \log(J+1))
(1+2ε)(J+1)(logn+log(J+1)), which is larger than the bound on qjq_j
qj​ for j>J+1j > J+1
j>J+1 since the coefficient is strictly larger.

But there's a potential collision issue: if jj
j is around (J+1)(1+ε)(J+1)(1+\varepsilon)
(J+1)(1+ε), then qjq_j
qj​ could be comparable to bJ+1b_{J+1}
bJ+1​, so I need to handle this carefully.

The fix is straightforward—I can choose bJ+1b_{J+1}
bJ+1​ as any prime in a small window around the target value cJ+1c_{J+1}
cJ+1​, and since primes are dense by the prime number theorem, I can always find one that avoids all the qiq_i
qi​'s. Alternatively, if some bjb_j
bj​ does coincide with a qiq_i
qi​, I can just treat it as part of the adjusted set, though that's messier.

Now I'm running into another issue with the set DD
D: Shortener's strategy of playing the smallest legal odd prime works for KK
K turns, but at some point Shortener might not have a legal move available.

If no legal odd prime exists, that means every odd prime up to nn
n is either already in AA
A or divides something in AA
A—a very restrictive condition. But this should only happen at the very end of the game when the antichain becomes maximal. As long as the game is ongoing, there should be some legal move available, even if it's a composite rather than an odd prime. So Shortener can adapt by playing a legal composite if needed, and the argument for Lemma 1 should still hold. le Q$ is illegal, then each such pp
p divides one of the previous qiq_i
qi​ or one of Prolonger's jj
j moves." This gives ϑ(Q)≤jlog⁡n+∑i<jlog⁡qi+O(1)\vartheta(Q) \le j\log n + \sum_{i<j} \log q_i + O(1)
ϑ(Q)≤jlogn+∑i<j​logqi​+O(1).

If Shortener cannot play any odd prime at all, that's a different regime. But actually the Lemma 1 argument shows that if every odd prime ≤Q\le Q
≤Q is illegal, then QQ
Q is bounded. So some odd prime >Q> Q
>Q is legal... wait no.

Lemma 1 says: there exists an odd prime ≤Q\le Q
≤Q that is legal, where QQ
Q is the RHS. So Shortener can play such an odd prime, and the smallest legal odd prime is ≤Q\le Q
≤Q.

So Shortener can always play some odd prime as long as there's a legal one available—which happens unless all odd primes up to nn
n are already in AA
A or divide something in AA
A.

Now I'm thinking about what happens if Prolonger plays in a way that makes AA
A maximal before Shortener finishes her KK
K prefix moves. Prolonger wants to maximize the total number of moves, so he wouldn't intentionally terminate early. He's constrained to legal moves, but he can always extend AA
A unless it's already maximal—meaning no integer in [2,n][2, n]
[2,n] can be added without violating the antichain property.

The analysis I have bounds ∣A∣|A|
∣A∣ at any termination point, which should be sufficient. Now I need to check whether the prime approximations I'm using are tight enough. I need primes bjb_j
bj​ with bj≈λj(log⁡n+log⁡j)b_j \approx \lambda j (\log n + \log j)
bj​≈λj(logn+logj) and bj≥qjb_j \ge q_j
bj​≥qj​ for all jj
j in the relevant range, and the sum ∑1/bj\sum 1/b_j
∑1/bj​ needs to converge to the right measure. By the prime number theorem, primes near xx
x have density roughly 1/log⁡x1/\log x
1/logx, so for x≈jlog⁡nx \approx j \log n
x≈jlogn the density is around 1/(log⁡j+log⁡log⁡n)1/(\log j + \log \log n)
1/(logj+loglogn). As jj
j approaches K=n/log⁡nK = n/\log n
K=n/logn, the analysis gets tighter.

To construct bjb_j
bj​, I pick a prime just above λqj\lambda q_j
λqj​ to ensure the lower bound holds. The gap between consecutive primes near xx
x is O(log⁡x)O(\log x)
O(logx) on average, so I can find bjb_j
bj​ in the range [λqj,λqj(1+O(log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n))][\lambda q_j, \lambda q_j (1 + O(\log\log n/\log n))]
[λqj​,λqj​(1+O(loglogn/logn))] without affecting the asymptotics. Now I need to verify that the constant CC
C in Lemma 1's induction hypothesis qi≤(1+ε)i(log⁡n+log⁡i+Clog⁡log⁡n)q_i \le (1+\varepsilon) i (\log n + \log i + C \log\log n)
qi​≤(1+ε)i(logn+logi+Cloglogn) remains uniform across all nn
n and ii
i.

For the induction to work, I need to absorb the implicit constants from ϑ(Q)∼Q\vartheta(Q) \sim Q
ϑ(Q)∼Q and the logarithmic bounds on qiq_i
qi​ into CC
C. Working through the bound on log⁡qi\log q_i
logqi​, I'm checking that for i≤Ki \le K
i≤K, the terms log⁡n+log⁡i\log n + \log i
logn+logi and Clog⁡log⁡nC\log\log n
Cloglogn combine properly when I take logarithms, using the expansion log⁡(A+B)=log⁡A+log⁡(1+B/A)\log(A + B) = \log A + \log(1 + B/A)
log(A+B)=logA+log(1+B/A) to control the error terms.

This simplifies to log⁡qi=log⁡i+log⁡log⁡n+O(1)\log q_i = \log i + \log\log n + O(1)
logqi​=logi+loglogn+O(1), but I'm realizing this gives me an O(1)O(1)
O(1) error rather than the O(log⁡log⁡n)O(\log\log n)
O(loglogn) I was expecting, so I need to reconsider the calculation.

When I sum over all i<ji < j
i<j, I get ∑i<jlog⁡qi=jlog⁡j−j+jlog⁡log⁡n+O(j)\sum_{i<j} \log q_i = j \log j - j + j\log\log n + O(j)
∑i<j​logqi​=jlogj−j+jloglogn+O(j), which means ϑ(Q)\vartheta(Q)
ϑ(Q) is bounded by this expression.

Now I'm setting Q=(1+ε)j(log⁡n+log⁡j+Clog⁡log⁡n)Q = (1+\varepsilon) j (\log n + \log j + C\log\log n)
Q=(1+ε)j(logn+logj+Cloglogn) and applying the lower bound ϑ(Q)≥(1−o(1))Q\vartheta(Q) \ge (1-o(1))Q
ϑ(Q)≥(1−o(1))Q to derive a contradiction. After dividing through by jj
j and rearranging, I need to show that the coefficient of log⁡log⁡n\log\log n
loglogn leads to an inconsistency.

For large nn
n, the term (ε−o(1))(log⁡n+log⁡j)(\varepsilon - o(1))(\log n + \log j)
(ε−o(1))(logn+logj) dominates and grows without bound, while the constant CC
C must satisfy C>1/(1+ε)C > 1/(1+\varepsilon)
C>1/(1+ε) for the inequality to hold. This suggests C=1C = 1
C=1 works asymptotically, but I need to verify the base case where j=1j = 1
j=1 to ensure the induction actually starts.

At j=1j = 1
j=1, the bound becomes q1≤(1+ε)(log⁡n+Clog⁡log⁡n)q_1 \le (1+\varepsilon)(\log n + C\log\log n)
q1​≤(1+ε)(logn+Cloglogn), but there's a problem: the argument relies on ϑ(Q)∼Q\vartheta(Q) \sim Q
ϑ(Q)∼Q holding for large QQ
Q, which breaks down when QQ
Q is small.

However, as n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞, we have Q=(1+ε)(log⁡n+Clog⁡log⁡n)→∞Q = (1+\varepsilon)(\log n + C\log\log n) \to \infty
Q=(1+ε)(logn+Cloglogn)→∞, so this actually works out.

Now I need to check the translation between the log-scale parameterization and the variable uu
u. Setting u=log⁡j/log⁡nu = \log j / \log n
u=logj/logn for p=bjp = b_j
p=bj​, the claim is that bj=(λ+o(1))j(1+u)log⁡nb_j = (\lambda + o(1)) j (1+u) \log n
bj​=(λ+o(1))j(1+u)logn. Let me verify this by expanding log⁡bj\log b_j
logbj​ and seeing if the pieces align correctly.

But wait—I'm noticing a potential issue. The uu
u used for pp
p is defined as log⁡p/log⁡n\log p / \log n
logp/logn, while the uu
u associated with j=nuj = n^u
j=nu is log⁡j/log⁡n\log j / \log n
logj/logn. These should be the same, but let me double-check by computing log⁡bj/log⁡n\log b_j / \log n
logbj​/logn directly and confirming it equals u+o(1)u + o(1)
u+o(1).

For the reciprocal sum ∑p∈B1/p\sum_{p \in B} 1/p
∑p∈B​1/p, I'm summing over the bjb_j
bj​ values from J<j≤KJ < j \le K
J<j≤K. The upper bound K=n/((2λ+η)log⁡n)K = n/((2\lambda+\eta)\log n)
K=n/((2λ+η)logn) gives log⁡K=log⁡n−log⁡log⁡n−O(1)\log K = \log n - \log\log n - O(1)
logK=logn−loglogn−O(1), so as jj
j approaches KK
K, the exponent u=log⁡j/log⁡nu = \log j/\log n
u=logj/logn approaches 1. At the lower end, j=J=nδj = J = n^\delta
j=J=nδ means u=log⁡J/log⁡n=δu = \log J/\log n = \delta
u=logJ/logn=δ. Now I'm approximating the sum as ∑1/(λj(1+uj)log⁡n)\sum 1/(\lambda j (1+u_j) \log n)
∑1/(λj(1+uj​)logn) and setting up a change of variables with dudu
du.

Converting to an integral, the reciprocal sum becomes ∫δ1−o(1)duλ(1+u)\int_\delta^{1 - o(1)} \frac{du}{\lambda(1+u)}
∫δ1−o(1)​λ(1+u)du​, where the upper limit approaches 1 since uK=log⁡K/log⁡n=1−log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n→1u_K = \log K/\log n = 1 - \log\log n/\log n \to 1
uK​=logK/logn=1−loglogn/logn→1 as n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞. So in the limit, ∑j1/bj→∫δ1du/(λ(1+u))\sum_{j} 1/b_j \to \int_\delta^1 du/(\lambda(1+u))
∑j​1/bj​→∫δ1​du/(λ(1+u)).

Now I'm moving on to analyzing how Prolonger's strategy interacts with the game dynamics.
Lemma 1 bounds Prolonger's jj
j moves by njn^j
nj in product, which holds regardless of which specific numbers Prolonger chooses—the argument works in the worst case where each prime p≤Qp \le Q
p≤Q either appeared previously or divides one of his moves.

For the sieve analysis, I need to count odd numbers up to nn
n that avoid all primes in the set Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​.

Now I'm computing the factorial moments of the number of primes from Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​ that divide a uniformly random odd integer M≤nM \le n
M≤n, which involves summing probabilities that products of distinct primes divide MM
M.

For products P=p1⋯pr≤nP = p_1 \cdots p_r \le n
P=p1​⋯pr​≤n, the probability is approximately 1/P1/P
1/P with an error of O(1/n)O(1/n)
O(1/n) relative to the mean, so the total error across all rr
r-subsets is bounded by the number of such subsets times the per-subset error.

With ∣Bλ,δ∣=K=n/log⁡n|B_{\lambda,\delta}| = K = n/\log n
∣Bλ,δ​∣=K=n/logn, I'm getting Kr/n=nr−1/(log⁡n)rK^r/n = n^{r-1}/(\log n)^r
Kr/n=nr−1/(logn)r, which grows for r≥1r \ge 1
r≥1 — that's problematic. Let me reconsider the expectation calculation directly: E(Xr)\mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
E(rX​) should sum the probabilities over all valid rr
r-tuples of primes.

For the probability that a product P=p1⋯prP = p_1 \cdots p_r
P=p1​⋯pr​ divides a random odd MM
M, I'm working out that P(P∣M)=(2/n)(⌊n/(2P)⌋+O(1))\mathbb{P}(P|M) = (2/n)(\lfloor n/(2P) \rfloor + O(1))
P(P∣M)=(2/n)(⌊n/(2P)⌋+O(1)), which simplifies the counting of odd multiples of PP
P in the range.

This gives me P(P∣M)=1/P+O(1/n)\mathbb{P}(P|M) = 1/P + O(1/n)
P(P∣M)=1/P+O(1/n), so each term contributes an error of O(1/n)O(1/n)
O(1/n). When I sum over all rr
r-subsets with P≤nP \le n
P≤n, the total error becomes (Kr/r!)⋅O(1/n)=O(Kr/(r!n))(K^r/r!) \cdot O(1/n) = O(K^r/(r! n))
(Kr/r!)⋅O(1/n)=O(Kr/(r!n)). With K=n/log⁡nK = n/\log n
K=n/logn, this scales as O(nr−1/((r!)(log⁡n)r))O(n^{r-1}/((r!)(\log n)^r))
O(nr−1/((r!)(logn)r)), which for r≥2r \ge 2
r≥2 grows like n/(log⁡n)2n/(\log n)^2
n/(logn)2 and dominates the main term—that's problematic. But wait, rr
r is actually bounded, so I need to reconsider the constraints.

Looking at the expectation E(Xr)\mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
E(rX​) more carefully, the main term comes from summing 1/P1/P
1/P over rr
r-subsets with P≤nP \le n
P≤n, which gives something like O(log⁡r)O(\log^r)
O(logr) of some quantity. For r=1r = 1
r=1, the sum ∑p∈B1/p\sum_{p \in B} 1/p
∑p∈B​1/p is roughly (1/λ)log⁡2(1/\lambda) \log 2
(1/λ)log2, which is bounded. For r=2r = 2
r=2, I'm summing 1/(p1p2)1/(p_1 p_2)
1/(p1​p2​) over pairs where p1p2≤np_1 p_2 \le n
p1​p2​≤n, with both primes from my set BB
B.

The error term is O(Kr/(r!n))O(K^r/(r! n))
O(Kr/(r!n)), which is fine for r=1r = 1
r=1 but blows up for r=2r = 2
r=2 since K2/(2n)∼n/log⁡2n→∞K^2/(2n) \sim n/\log^2 n \to \infty
K2/(2n)∼n/log2n→∞. But I need to reconsider—the number of valid rr
r-subsets isn't just ∣B∣r|B|^r
∣B∣r; it's constrained by the product P=p1⋯pr≤nP = p_1 \cdots p_r \le n
P=p1​⋯pr​≤n, which significantly restricts how many pairs I'm actually counting.

For r=2r = 2
r=2 specifically, I'm looking at pairs where each prime is at least nδn^\delta
nδ and their product is at most nn
n. The count comes down to summing over valid p1p_1
p1​ values and counting primes p2≤n/p1p_2 \le n/p_1
p2​≤n/p1​, which gives roughly n/log⁡nn/\log n
n/logn overall—much smaller than the naive bound.

Since the error per subset is O(1/n)O(1/n)
O(1/n) and there are only O(n/log⁡n)O(n/\log n)
O(n/logn) valid pairs, the total error shrinks to zero. I was worried about double-counting, but the constraint P≤nP \le n
P≤n naturally limits the number of valid tuples to O(n)O(n)
O(n) rather than blowing up exponentially.

Now extending to general rr
r: I need to count rr
r-tuples of primes where each prime is at least nδn^\delta
nδ and their product stays at most nn
n. The AM-GM inequality gives me tight restrictions on how large these primes can be.

For the counting, a naive bound using the prime counting function gives O(nr/(log⁡n)r)O(n^r / (\log n)^r)
O(nr/(logn)r), which is way too loose. I'm trying a tighter approach using Landau's result on integers with exactly rr
r distinct prime factors, which should give me the right growth rate.

The key insight is that the error per subset is O(1/n)O(1/n)
O(1/n), and since there are only finitely many values of rr
r to consider (bounded by 1/δ1/\delta
1/δ), the total error across all of them vanishes as n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞.

Now I'm checking the order of limits carefully. The bound on N(q1,...,qK)/nN(q_1, ..., q_K)/n
N(q1​,...,qK​)/n is squeezed between the limit of N(Bλ,δ)/nN(B_{\lambda,\delta})/n
N(Bλ,δ​)/n, which should give me the desired asymptotic.

But there's a constraint: Lemma 2 requires qj≤bjq_j \le b_j
qj​≤bj​ for all j>Jj > J
j>J, which forces λ>1+ε\lambda > 1 + \varepsilon
λ>1+ε from Lemma 1, so I need to be careful about how λ\lambda
λ approaches 1.

The correct order is to first fix λ>1\lambda > 1
λ>1 and δ>0\delta > 0
δ>0, then let n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞ to bound the limsup by Vλ,δ/2\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}/2
Vλ,δ​/2, then shrink δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0 to get Vλ/2\mathcal{V}_\lambda/2
Vλ​/2, and finally take λ→1\lambda \to 1
λ→1 to recover V\mathcal{V}
V. Each step produces a valid upper bound and the limits converge properly, so this ordering works. Though I'm sensing there might be another subtlety lurking here.

When δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0, the prefix length KK
K stays fixed since it depends only on λ\lambda
λ and η\eta
η, but J=nδJ = n^\delta
J=nδ shrinks toward 1. After dropping the first JJ
J primes, we're left with roughly K−J≈n/log⁡nK - J \approx n/\log n
K−J≈n/logn primes for δ<1\delta < 1
δ<1. As δ\delta
δ decreases further, JJ
J becomes negligible compared to the remaining count.

Now I need to verify whether this approach actually beats the 5/165/16
5/16 bound. The researcher claims V/2≈0.22<5/16=0.3125\mathcal{V}/2 \approx 0.22 < 5/16 = 0.3125
V/2≈0.22<5/16=0.3125, so let me trace through the overall argument to see if the improvement holds.

The old approach used second-order Bonferroni with a crude bound on the sieve weights, capping them at 1/21/2
1/2. The new approach replaces this with the full logarithmic density profile and applies infinite-order inclusion-exclusion, which converges thanks to the lower bound on prime gaps. Since the density profile du/(1+u)du/(1+u)
du/(1+u) varies across [0,1][0,1]
[0,1] and is smaller near the boundary, the sieve becomes more efficient than the uniform bound. This looks like a genuine improvement, and the constant V/2≈0.22\mathcal{V}/2 \approx 0.22
V/2≈0.22 does beat the old threshold.

Now I'm noticing that an independent derivation in the cross-reference gives essentially the same constant, ρ=F/2≈0.2200145\rho = F/2 \approx 0.2200145
ρ=F/2≈0.2200145, which matches my κ=V/2≈0.22002\kappa = \mathcal{V}/2 \approx 0.22002
κ=V/2≈0.22002 to within a tiny discrepancy in the fifth decimal place. I should verify whether V\mathcal{V}
V is closer to 0.440030.44003
0.44003 or 0.44002900.4400290
0.4400290—the difference is only about 4×10−64 \times 10^{-6}
4×10−6, likely just rounding error in the final digit.

Now I'm recognizing this as a standard probabilistic sieve argument using the factorial moment method, which connects to classical results like Brun's and Selberg's sieves, the fundamental lemma of sieve theory for coprimality conditions, and Mertens-type estimates.
The integral ∫01du/(1+u)=log⁡2\int_0^1 du/(1+u) = \log 2
∫01​du/(1+u)=log2 appears in the context of Dickman's function for smooth numbers, and I'm seeing how the inclusion-exclusion formula P(X=0)=∑(−1)rE(Xr)\mathbb{P}(X=0) = \sum (-1)^r \mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
P(X=0)=∑(−1)rE(rX​) connects to this framework.

The expectation E(Xr)\mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
E(rX​) involves an integral over a simplex with the measure du/(1+u)du/(1+u)
du/(1+u), which is characteristic of sieve theory results for large primes or almost primes. For a uniformly random integer in [1,N][1, N]
[1,N], the distribution of prime factors with logarithms normalized by log⁡N\log N
logN converges to a Poisson point process, and I'm trying to pin down exactly which regime of primes this applies to.

I'm now thinking about the connection to smooth numbers—specifically, the count of integers up to nn
n that are nδn^\delta
nδ-smooth (having all prime factors below nδn^\delta
nδ) is given by ρ(1/δ)n\rho(1/\delta) n
ρ(1/δ)n where ρ\rho
ρ is Dickman's function. But the sieve here isn't over all primes in that range; it's over a specific subset Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​ with a particular density structure involving 1/(λ(1+u))1/(\lambda(1+u))
1/(λ(1+u)).

The key insight is that we're sieving by a thinned set of primes rather than the full set, and this thinning factor affects the final proportion of survivors. This modified proportion is what V\mathcal{V}
V represents, and I suspect this might be a novel computation that extends the classical Dickman/Buchstab framework.

I'm trying to determine whether the integral formula for V\mathcal{V}
V involving the alternating sum and the product of 1/(1+ui)1/(1+u_i)
1/(1+ui​) terms has a known closed form.

Now I'm working through a change of variables to simplify the integral, substituting vi=1+uiv_i = 1 + u_i
vi​=1+ui​ to shift the domain, and then exploring whether techniques like the Laplace transform or Abel's identity might help evaluate this sum of integrals.

I'm reconsidering the problem through a probabilistic lens—thinking of V\mathcal{V}
V as the density of odd integers up to nn
n that avoid all primes in a certain set, which is equivalent to asking for the probability that a random odd number isn't divisible by any of those primes.

Using the standard sieve approximation, this probability should be roughly e−∑1/pe^{-\sum 1/p}
e−∑1/p, and with the specific parameters given, that sum converges to log⁡2\log 2
log2, giving an expected value around 1/21/2
1/2. But the actual computed value is 0.440.44
0.44, which is lower than this estimate—so either the approximation is breaking down or I'm missing a constraint that's reducing the density further. Let me think again. P(no p∣M)\mathbb{P}(\text{no } p | M)
P(no p∣M) bound: we have ∑p∈B1/p≈log⁡2\sum_{p \in B} 1/p \approx \log 2
∑p∈B​1/p≈log2. If events were independent, P=∏(1−1/p)\mathbb{P} = \prod(1 - 1/p)
P=∏(1−1/p). But they're not independent, and the constraint p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n matters.

Actually, looking at Mertens: ∏p≤x(1−1/p)∼e−γ/log⁡x\prod_{p \le x}(1 - 1/p) \sim e^{-\gamma}/\log x
∏p≤x​(1−1/p)∼e−γ/logx. For x=nβx = n^\beta
x=nβ, this is ∼e−γ/(βlog⁡n)\sim e^{-\gamma}/(\beta \log n)
∼e−γ/(βlogn). For primes in [nδ,n][n^\delta, n]
[nδ,n]: ∏(1−1/p)∼δ\prod(1 - 1/p) \sim \delta
∏(1−1/p)∼δ. So the Dickman proportion for δ=1\delta = 1
δ=1 is... hmm actually Dickman's function ρ(1)=1\rho(1) = 1
ρ(1)=1 (no smoothness constraint).

Now I'm connecting this to the general framework: for MM
M uniform on [1,n][1, n]
[1,n], the probability that MM
M is n1/kn^{1/k}
n1/k-smooth approaches ρ(k)\rho(k)
ρ(k), which means the probability that no prime factor exceeds nδn^\delta
nδ approaches ρ(1/δ)\rho(1/\delta)
ρ(1/δ). As δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0, this probability vanishes. But I'm actually sieving by a restricted subset BB
B of primes, not all primes up to nn
n.

The key insight is that BB
B has a specific density on the logarithmic scale—it's thinned by a factor of 1/(λ(1+u))1/(\lambda(1+u))
1/(λ(1+u)) compared to the full set of primes. At u=1u = 1
u=1, this means I'm sieving by roughly half the primes in that range when λ=1\lambda = 1
λ=1.

This isn't a standard Dickman-type calculation, but rather something tailored to this particular thinning process. The researcher's value of V≈0.44\mathcal{V} \approx 0.44
V≈0.44 seems reasonable given the structure.

Let me work through the computation myself to verify. I have I0=1I_0 = 1
I0​=1 and I1=log⁡2≈0.6931I_1 = \log 2 \approx 0.6931
I1​=log2≈0.6931. For I2I_2
I2​, I need to evaluate a double integral involving the reciprocal of products of (1+ui)(1+u_i)
(1+ui​) terms.

Now I'm tackling the integral ∫01log⁡(2−u)/(1+u)du\int_0^1 \log(2-u)/(1+u) du
∫01​log(2−u)/(1+u)du by substituting t=2−ut = 2-u
t=2−u to flip the bounds, then expanding the denominator as a power series to integrate term by term.

For each term, I'm using integration by parts on ∫12tklog⁡t dt\int_1^2 t^k \log t \, dt
∫12​tklogtdt, which gives me tk+1/(k+1)log⁡t−tk+1/(k+1)2t^{k+1}/(k+1) \log t - t^{k+1}/(k+1)^2
tk+1/(k+1)logt−tk+1/(k+1)2. Evaluating between the bounds yields 2k+1log⁡2/(k+1)−(2k+1−1)/(k+1)22^{k+1} \log 2/(k+1) - (2^{k+1} - 1)/(k+1)^2
2k+1log2/(k+1)−(2k+1−1)/(k+1)2. Now I'm summing these results across all kk
k to get the final answer.

For the first part, I'm recognizing that log⁡2∑2k+1/((k+1)3k+1)\log 2 \sum 2^{k+1}/((k+1) 3^{k+1})
log2∑2k+1/((k+1)3k+1) becomes log⁡2∑j=1∞(2/3)j/j\log 2 \sum_{j=1}^\infty (2/3)^j / j
log2∑j=1∞​(2/3)j/j, which is the Taylor series for −log⁡(1−2/3)=log⁡3-\log(1 - 2/3) = \log 3
−log(1−2/3)=log3. So the first part evaluates to log⁡2⋅log⁡3≈0.7617\log 2 \cdot \log 3 \approx 0.7617
log2⋅log3≈0.7617. For the second part, I'm splitting it into two sums involving the dilogarithm function and a simpler series.

Now I'm using the reflection formula for the dilogarithm to relate Li2(2/3)\text{Li}_2(2/3)
Li2​(2/3) and Li2(1/3)\text{Li}_2(1/3)
Li2​(1/3). The formula gives me Li2(2/3)=π2/6−log⁡(2/3)log⁡(1/3)−Li2(1/3)\text{Li}_2(2/3) = \pi^2/6 - \log(2/3)\log(1/3) - \text{Li}_2(1/3)
Li2​(2/3)=π2/6−log(2/3)log(1/3)−Li2​(1/3), so when I subtract Li2(1/3)\text{Li}_2(1/3)
Li2​(1/3) from both sides, I get Li2(2/3)−Li2(1/3)=π2/6−log⁡(2/3)log⁡(1/3)−2Li2(1/3)\text{Li}_2(2/3) - \text{Li}_2(1/3) = \pi^2/6 - \log(2/3)\log(1/3) - 2\text{Li}_2(1/3)
Li2​(2/3)−Li2​(1/3)=π2/6−log(2/3)log(1/3)−2Li2​(1/3).

Now I'm plugging in numerical values: π2/6≈1.6449\pi^2/6 \approx 1.6449
π2/6≈1.6449, the product log⁡(2/3)log⁡(1/3)≈0.4455\log(2/3)\log(1/3) \approx 0.4455
log(2/3)log(1/3)≈0.4455, and 2Li2(1/3)≈0.73262\text{Li}_2(1/3) \approx 0.7326
2Li2​(1/3)≈0.7326, which gives me Li2(2/3)−Li2(1/3)≈0.4668\text{Li}_2(2/3) - \text{Li}_2(1/3) \approx 0.4668
Li2​(2/3)−Li2​(1/3)≈0.4668. Substituting back into my integral formula, I get ∫01log⁡(2−u)/(1+u)du≈0.2949\int_0^1 \log(2-u)/(1+u) du \approx 0.2949
∫01​log(2−u)/(1+u)du≈0.2949, so I2≈0.1475I_2 \approx 0.1475
I2​≈0.1475.

The researcher's value of 0.14722067690.1472206769
0.1472206769 is very close, so this checks out. I should verify this more carefully with a numerical computation to make sure everything's consistent, then write up my audit response addressing the proof adversarially.

Let me structure this: I'll start with an overall verdict, then go through the seven pressure-test points, connect it to the literature, verify the numerics with code, and identify the weakest links in the argument.
I need to compute V\mathcal{V}
V using the recursive formula for the simplex integrals—where I1=log⁡2I_1 = \log 2
I1​=log2 and each subsequent IrI_r
Ir​ builds from the previous one through integration over the unit interval.

Computing the simplex integrals... I'm setting up a recursive computation where Jr(t)J_r(t)
Jr​(t) integrates the product over rr
r variables, with the base case J1(t)=log⁡(1+t)J_1(t) = \log(1+t)
J1​(t)=log(1+t) and each subsequent layer building from the previous one. Since the algebra is getting unwieldy, I'll move to numerical evaluation in the sandbox to verify the approach works, then structure my response around checking each lemma and component of the proof before connecting to the literature. I need to verify whether V\mathcal{V}
V corresponds to a known constant and find a closed form for it. Let me set up the generating function approach—I'll define F(t)=∑r(−1)rIr(t)F(t) = \sum_r (-1)^r I_r(t)
F(t)=∑r​(−1)rIr​(t) where Ir(t)=Jr(t)/r!I_r(t) = J_r(t)/r!
Ir​(t)=Jr​(t)/r!, and work through the differential equation to see if this simplifies to something recognizable. Now I'm working through the derivative of JrJ_r
Jr​ using the Leibniz rule for differentiation under the integral sign. After substituting v=t−uv = t - u
v=t−u, I can differentiate with respect to tt
t to get Jr−1(t)J_{r-1}(t)
Jr−1​(t) minus an integral term involving the derivative of the denominator.

This direct approach is getting messy, so I'm switching to an exponential generating function perspective. I'm defining F(t,x)=∑rxrJr(t)/r!F(t, x) = \sum_r x^r J_r(t)/r!
F(t,x)=∑r​xrJr​(t)/r! and recognizing that Jr(t)J_r(t)
Jr​(t) represents an integral over all non-negative uiu_i
ui​ summing to at most tt
t, weighted by the product 1/(1+ui)1/(1+u_i)
1/(1+ui​). To handle the constraint ∑ui≤t\sum u_i \le t
∑ui​≤t, I'm using a contour integral representation with an indicator function.

Actually, the Laplace transform approach seems cleaner. I'm computing J^r(s)=∫0∞e−stJr(t)dt\hat{J}_r(s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} J_r(t) dt
J^r​(s)=∫0∞​e−stJr​(t)dt by swapping the order of integration—fixing the uiu_i
ui​ values first, then integrating over tt
t from ∑ui\sum u_i
∑ui​ to infinity, which gives me e−s∑ui/se^{-s \sum u_i}/s
e−s∑ui​/s.

This factors into a product of integrals, each of the form ∫0∞e−su/(1+u)du=esE1(s)\int_0^\infty e^{-su}/(1+u) du = e^s E_1(s)
∫0∞​e−su/(1+u)du=esE1​(s) where E1E_1
E1​ is the exponential integral. So I get J^r(s)=(1/s)[esE1(s)]r\hat{J}_r(s) = (1/s)[e^s E_1(s)]^r
J^r​(s)=(1/s)[esE1​(s)]r, and now I need to work out F^(s)\hat{F}(s)
F^(s) from there.

The Laplace transform of FF
F turns out to be (1/s)exp⁡(−esE1(s))(1/s) \exp(-e^s E_1(s))
(1/s)exp(−esE1​(s)), which gives me FF
F across the entire positive real line. To find F(1)F(1)
F(1), I'd need to invert this Laplace transform at that specific point, which doesn't have a nice closed form.

The researcher reports V≈0.44003\mathcal{V} \approx 0.44003
V≈0.44003, so let me verify this numerically using Python.

Now I should think through how to structure my response to the user. This is a detailed audit, so I want to be thorough while staying focused. Looking at the seven key points, I'm assessing which ones carry the most risk: the uniformity claims in Lemma 1 and the factorial moment limit need careful attention to constants and limiting arguments, while the injectivity result, measure convergence, exactness, and dominated convergence applications are all fairly straightforward.
The critical vulnerabilities are clearer now. First, Lemma 2's replacement step requires qj≤bjq_j \le b_j
qj​≤bj​ for all j>Jj > J
j>J, but Lemma 1 only guarantees this with high probability or for specific ε\varepsilon
ε values—I need to ensure λ\lambda
λ is chosen appropriately in terms of ε\varepsilon
ε. Second, I should verify whether the strategy is actually well-defined across all KK
K turns, especially if Prolonger can terminate the game early. Third, there's a question about whether Prolonger playing composite numbers could "exhaust" the available primes in a way that breaks the analysis.

Actually, thinking through the composite strategy: when Prolonger plays a composite xx
x, any prime dividing xx
x becomes illegal for Shortener since those primes would be comparable to xx
x. But Lemma 1 already accounts for this—the product of Prolonger's moves is bounded by njn^j
nj, which limits how many primes ≤Q\le Q
≤Q can be divisors of those composites. So the bound holds regardless of Prolonger's choice.

Now there's another angle I'm checking: Shortener's strategy specifies playing the smallest legal odd prime, which means 2 never gets played by Shortener.
Prolonger could play 2 if he wants, which would force all even numbers out of the antichain since they'd be comparable to 2. But if Prolonger doesn't play 2, then even numbers might still appear in the antichain. The key question is whether the injection ϕ(x)=x/2v2(x)\phi(x) = x/2^{v_2(x)}
ϕ(x)=x/2v2​(x) (extracting the odd part) remains valid in both cases. If two antichain elements xx
x and yy
y have the same odd part, they must be equal—I need to verify this holds regardless of whether 2 is in play.

Now I'm checking that ϕ\phi
ϕ is injective on antichains. If x=2amx = 2^a m
x=2am and y=2bmy = 2^b m
y=2bm with the same odd part mm
m, then assuming a≤ba \le b
a≤b means xx
x divides yy
y, so they must be equal by the antichain property. This works without needing 2 to be in AA
A at all.

The final antichain AA
A might contain even numbers, but when I compress via ϕ\phi
ϕ, I get odd integers. The image consists of the odd primes q1,...,qKq_1, ..., q_K
q1​,...,qK​ from Shortener's prefix plus other odd integers coprime to all of them, so the antichain size is bounded by KK
K plus the count of such coprime odd integers.

I'm verifying that the qjq_j
qj​'s themselves appear in the image—they're accounted for separately in the KK
K term since they're not coprime to themselves. The question is whether the image can contain other multiples of the qjq_j
qj​'s beyond the primes themselves.

If m=qjm′m = q_j m'
m=qj​m′ with m′>1m' > 1
m′>1, then mm
m comes from some x=2aqjm′x = 2^a q_j m'
x=2aqj​m′ in AA
A, which means qjq_j
qj​ divides xx
x. But since qj∈Aq_j \in A
qj​∈A and x>qjx > q_j
x>qj​, they'd be comparable in the poset—a contradiction. The edge case where x=qjx = q_j
x=qj​ itself gives ϕ(qj)=qj\phi(q_j) = q_j
ϕ(qj​)=qj​, which is fine as an image element, but I need to check if this creates any issues.

Actually, if x≠qjx \neq q_j
x=qj​, then xx
x is a strict multiple of qjq_j
qj​, which violates the antichain property. So all image elements outside the qjq_j
qj​ set must be coprime to every qjq_j
qj​.

Now I'm ready to compute actual values. I need to calculate IrI_r
Ir​ for r=1,2,3,4r = 1, 2, 3, 4
r=1,2,3,4, then sum them with alternating signs to get V\mathcal{V}
V, and check the Leibniz tail behavior. I'll write code to compute the integrals numerically.

Writing computation code... Computing J_r values recursively by numerically integrating over the grid, then extracting I_r by dividing the final value by r factorial and printing results for r from 0 to 6.
Actually, I'm concerned this recursive approach might accumulate numerical errors. Let me reconsider the integral formulation—I can rewrite it as a Volterra equation and compute it more directly on a fine grid, or switch to Monte Carlo sampling for the higher-order terms while handling the first couple analytically.
I've got I0=1I_0 = 1
I0​=1 and I1=log⁡2I_1 = \log 2
I1​=log2, so let me compute I2I_2
I2​ numerically. I'll use the computational tools to evaluate this, then think through the connection to classical sieve theory—the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to indicator random variables for prime divisibility is a well-known technique in analytic number theory.

The Kubilius model treats divisibility events by small primes as approximately independent Bernoulli trials, which underlies results like the Erdős-Kac theorem on the distribution of prime factors. Since the primes in Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​ fall in the range [nδ,n][n^\delta, n]
[nδ,n], this model might apply to the smaller primes in the factorization, and the researcher's result could be a variant of this classical framework.

Now I'm recognizing this as related to the Landau-Mertens-Wirsing type results on the density of integers avoiding a given set of primes. The key formula gives the proportion of integers up to nn
n whose prime factors all lie outside a set SS
S, which equals approximately ∏p∈S(1−1/p)\prod_{p \in S}(1 - 1/p)
∏p∈S​(1−1/p) when the sum of reciprocals converges. Since ∑p∈Bλ,δ1/p\sum_{p \in B_{\lambda,\delta}} 1/p
∑p∈Bλ,δ​​1/p is finite, I should be able to express V\mathcal{V}
V as a product over these primes, which simplifies to an exponential of the logarithmic sum.

Working through the calculation, the sum ∑1/p\sum 1/p
∑1/p over the relevant primes approaches (1/λ)log⁡2(1/\lambda) \log 2
(1/λ)log2, so V≈2−1/λ\mathcal{V} \approx 2^{-1/\lambda}
V≈2−1/λ. For λ=1\lambda = 1
λ=1, this gives V≈0.5\mathcal{V} \approx 0.5
V≈0.5, but the researcher's numerical result is around 0.440.44
0.44—there's a meaningful gap here that I need to investigate further.

The key difference is the constraint p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n (or equivalently u1+...+ur≤1u_1 + ... + u_r \le 1
u1​+...+ur​≤1 in log space). In the standard Mertens-like product ∏(1−1/p)\prod(1 - 1/p)
∏(1−1/p), the expansion includes all pairs and higher-order terms without restriction, but the researcher's sieve enforces this upper bound constraint, which suppresses the survivor probability and explains why the actual value is lower than the naive estimate.

Now I'm computing the actual contribution from pairs of primes. The unconstrained sum gives roughly (log⁡2/λ)2/2(\log 2/\lambda)^2/2
(log2/λ)2/2 after accounting for the prime density, but when I impose the constraint pq≤npq \le n
pq≤n and work through the integral in log-space coordinates, the constrained sum comes out to about 0.1475/λ20.1475/\lambda^2
0.1475/λ2, which is noticeably smaller than the unconstrained version.

The difference between these—about 0.0930.093
0.093—is substantial, which means the constraint genuinely affects the calculation. This explains why the naive Mertens-based estimate of V≈1/2\mathcal{V} \approx 1/2
V≈1/2 fails: it doesn't account for the upper bound on the product of primes. The researcher's value of V≈0.44\mathcal{V} \approx 0.44
V≈0.44 properly incorporates this constraint, making it the correct estimate.

Now I'm checking whether this constraint actually impacts the true probability P(X=0)\mathbb{P}(X = 0)
P(X=0) using inclusion-exclusion. For the product p1⋯prp_1 \cdots p_r
p1​⋯pr​ to divide MM
M, we need p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n—otherwise no integer M≤nM \le n
M≤n could be divisible by it. So the constraint is indeed real and necessary.

The researcher's estimate of V≈0.44\mathcal{V} \approx 0.44
V≈0.44 is correct in principle and differs from the naive 1/21/2
1/2. The error term in the probability calculation is O(1/n)O(1/n)
O(1/n) per subset, which sums to o(1)o(1)
o(1) overall, so it vanishes in the limit. This means the sum reduces to ∑p1<...<pr∈B,P≤n1/P+o(1)\sum_{p_1 < ... < p_r \in B, P \le n} 1/P + o(1)
∑p1​<...<pr​∈B,P≤n​1/P+o(1), which converts to an integral giving Ir/λrI_r/\lambda^r
Ir​/λr. The final answer converges to P(X=0)→∑(−1)rIr/λr\mathbb{P}(X = 0) \to \sum (-1)^r I_r/\lambda^r
P(X=0)→∑(−1)rIr​/λr as n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞.

When λ=1\lambda = 1
λ=1, this recovers V\mathcal{V}
V, but I need to double-check whether the 1/λr1/\lambda^r
1/λr factor is already built into the definition of IrI_r
Ir​ or if it appears separately in the formula. I'm not entirely sure how the alternating signs affect the comparison when scaling by 1/λr1/\lambda^r
1/λr, but the overall approach seems sound and the numerical result of V≈0.44\mathcal{V} \approx 0.44
V≈0.44 checks out. Let me verify this with a quick calculation and also cross-check against the reference value—if F/2≈0.2200145F/2 \approx 0.2200145
F/2≈0.2200145, then F≈0.4400290F \approx 0.4400290
F≈0.4400290, which should match V\mathcal{V}
V.

Now I'm computing V\mathcal{V}
V to higher precision to see if the small discrepancy is just rounding error. Before I run the code, though, I want to think through one more potential issue with the game-theoretic setup—specifically whether it's valid to assume Shortener commits to this particular strategy when we're trying to bound the minimax value.

If Shortener plays the smallest legal odd prime for KK
K turns, then the bound on ∣A(S∗,P)∣|A(S^*, P)|
∣A(S∗,P)∣ holds regardless of what Prolonger does, which means L(n)≤0.22n+o(n)L(n) \le 0.22n + o(n)
L(n)≤0.22n+o(n). The key insight is that while the primes qjq_j
qj​ depend on Prolonger's moves through legality constraints, Lemma 1 gives us an upper bound on each qjq_j
qj​ that doesn't depend on Prolonger's strategy, so the overall bound on N(q1,...,qK)N(q_1, ..., q_K)
N(q1​,...,qK​) is also independent of Prolonger's choices.

Now I'm checking whether the analysis covers the full game—not just Shortener's initial KK
K moves but everything after. The bound ∣A∣≤K+N|A| \le K + N
∣A∣≤K+N accounts for the total antichain size across all moves, so that's settled.

For the tightness question: if the actual qjq_j
qj​ values grow like (1+o(1))jlog⁡n(1+o(1))j\log n
(1+o(1))jlogn, then the bound is essentially tight. But if the real primes are significantly smaller than what Lemma 1 allows, we might get a better estimate. Lemma 2 lets us work with worst-case bounds through the bjb_j
bj​ parameters, which gives us a conservative upper bound.

Now I'm looking at the integral IrI_r
Ir​ and whether it properly handles the boundary at ui=0u_i = 0
ui​=0 versus ui≥δu_i \ge \delta
ui​≥δ. The final formula after taking δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0 has the integrand finite at ui=0u_i = 0
ui​=0, so it's well-defined. The proof uses N(Bλ,δ)N(B_{\lambda,\delta})
N(Bλ,δ​) which requires ui≥δu_i \ge \delta
ui​≥δ, and as δ\delta
δ shrinks to zero, we're pushing the constraint boundary toward zero. I need to check whether the number of terms or the integral value changes as we approach this limit.

The density of primes near u=0u = 0
u=0 is 1/(λ(1+u))1/(\lambda(1+u))
1/(λ(1+u)), which stays finite, and the integral ∫0δdu/(1+u)\int_0^\delta du/(1+u)
∫0δ​du/(1+u) vanishes as δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0, so the contribution from small uu
u is negligible. But there's a subtlety: the original setup includes small primes like q1q_1
q1​ (around log⁡n\log n
logn) that map to u≈0u \approx 0
u≈0, and when we drop the first JJ
J primes, we're removing these small-uu
u terms from the sum.

Dropping primes can only increase the number of survivors, so we lose the benefit of those small-jj
j primes in the upper bound. But if we keep them instead, their reciprocals are each around 1/log⁡n1/\log n
1/logn, and summing over j≤J=nδj \le J = n^\delta
j≤J=nδ gives a total contribution of roughly...

Actually, the sum works out to approximately δ\delta
δ, which is small. So dropping the small-jj
j primes only costs us O(δ)O(\delta)
O(δ) in reciprocal mass—a minor weakening of the bound. As δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0, we recover the full mass, though I need to be careful: J=nδJ = n^\delta
J=nδ means J→∞J \to \infty
J→∞ as nn
n grows even for fixed δ>0\delta > 0
δ>0.

The limiting argument goes: first take n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞ for fixed δ\delta
δ and λ\lambda
λ, giving N(Bλ,δ)/(n/2)→Vλ,δN(B_{\lambda,\delta})/(n/2) \to \mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
N(Bλ,δ​)/(n/2)→Vλ,δ​. Then as δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0, the volume Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
Vλ,δ​ decreases monotonically toward Vλ\mathcal{V}_\lambda
Vλ​.

This makes sense because as δ\delta
δ shrinks, the integration region expands and the truncation grows, including more primes in the sieve. With a more effective sieve, the survival probability drops, so Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
Vλ,δ​ decreases. For the upper bound, I'm taking the lim sup⁡\limsup
limsup as δ\delta
δ vanishes.

Now I see the full picture: the researcher's bound holds for each pair (δ,λ)(\delta, \lambda)
(δ,λ), so I can optimize by letting δ\delta
δ approach zero and λ\lambda
λ approach 1 to get the tightest upper bound on the density ratio.

The key question is whether Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
Vλ,δ​ is continuous in these parameters and whether it's monotonically decreasing as I approach the boundary values—if so, the infimum would equal V\mathcal{V}
V exactly. I need to recalculate this more carefully. Each integral picks up a factor of 1/λ1/\lambda
1/λ from the measure dui/(λ(1+ui))du_i/(\lambda(1+u_i))
dui​/(λ(1+ui​)), so an rr
r-fold integral gives 1/λr1/\lambda^r
1/λr. This means Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
Vλ,δ​ is a sum over rr
r from 0 to ⌊1/δ⌋\lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor
⌊1/δ⌋ with alternating signs, where each term is Ir(δ)/λrI_r^{(\delta)}/\lambda^r
Ir(δ)​/λr and Ir(δ)I_r^{(\delta)}
Ir(δ)​ represents the integral over the constrained region with the (1+ui)(1+u_i)
(1+ui​) factors in the denominator. Now I'm examining what happens as δ\delta
δ shrinks toward zero. The derivative with respect to λ\lambda
λ gives I1/λ2−2I2/λ3+3I3/λ4−...I_1/\lambda^2 - 2I_2/\lambda^3 + 3I_3/\lambda^4 - ...
I1​/λ2−2I2​/λ3+3I3​/λ4−..., which at λ=1\lambda = 1
λ=1 becomes I1−2I2+3I3−4I4+...I_1 - 2I_2 + 3I_3 - 4I_4 + ...
I1​−2I2​+3I3​−4I4​+... — the sign isn't immediately clear. Rather than resolve this, I'll just take the limits in order: n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞, then δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0, then λ→1\lambda \to 1
λ→1, since the bound holds at each fixed pair (δ,λ)(\delta, \lambda)
(δ,λ) and the limits should commute nicely. Now let me verify this numerically with some code, and then I'll consolidate everything into a clean response with the main verdict and key improvements.

One thing I'm noticing though: the cross-reference gives ρ=F/2≈0.2200145\rho = F/2 \approx 0.2200145
ρ=F/2≈0.2200145, while the researcher reports κ=V/2≈0.22002\kappa = \mathcal{V}/2 \approx 0.22002
κ=V/2≈0.22002. These should be the same constant if they're measuring the same thing, but they differ by about 5.5×10−65.5 \times 10^{-6}
5.5×10−6 in the fifth decimal place — close enough that it might just be precision, but worth checking whether they're actually identical.

I'll compute V\mathcal{V}
V to high precision using numerical integration in Python, then cross-check against the literature to see if these values converge or if there's a genuine discrepancy.
Show moreDoneI'll audit this proof systematically. Let me first verify the numerical claims computationally, then check for literature connections, then work through the structural issues.Verified mathematical constants and convergence properties rigorouslyVerified mathematical constants and convergence properties rigorouslyThe numerical verification matches the researcher's values precisely. The constant V/2=0.2200145190...\mathcal{V}/2 = 0.2200145190...
V/2=0.2200145190... also matches the cross-reference value exactly (the researcher's "0.22002" is a rounding). Let me now verify alternating-series convergence and check one more pressure point.

I've gathered enough data.

∑1/qj​≥log2) is confirmed numerically even against an adversarial block-product Prolonger. The problem statement's "universal block-product counter" cap (st≤1/2s_t \leq 1/2
st​≤1/2) is inconsistent with this. Let me do one final check and then write up the audit.
Identified novel research problem and organized technical responseIdentified novel research problem and organized technical responseNow I have enough to write a comprehensive audit. Let me organize the findings:

Audit of the L(n)≤(0.22002+o(1))nL(n) \le (0.22002 + o(1))n
L(n)≤(0.22002+o(1))n proof

Bottom line
The proof is substantially correct. Numerical verification reproduces V/2=0.2200145190...\mathcal{V}/2 = 0.2200145190...
V/2=0.2200145190... to 10−1010^{-10}
10−10 precision, exactly matching the cross-reference's ρ=F/2≈0.2200145\rho = F/2 \approx 0.2200145
ρ=F/2≈0.2200145 — the researcher's "0.22002" is just a rounded display of the same number. Two independent derivations converging on the same value at this precision is strong circumstantial evidence of correctness. That said, several hidden-assumption spots need tightening and one prior-work claim is directly contradicted by the new Lemma 1.

Weakest link: the implicit distinctness requirement in the one-at-a-time application of Lemma 2 (Section 2 below). Fixable, but unstated.
**Biggest surprise:** Lemma 1 **contradicts** the problem statement's claim that "a universal block-product Prolonger counter forces Shortener's accessible prime-reciprocal mass to be at most 1/2+o(1)1/2 + o(1)
1/2+o(1)." Lemma 1 proves ∑1/qj≥log⁡2−o(1)≈0.693\sum 1/q_j \ge \log 2 - o(1) \approx 0.693
∑1/qj​≥log2−o(1)≈0.693 *universally* over Prolonger strategies. I verified this in simulation (reciprocal sum grew to 1.17 at n=2×104n = 2 \times 10^4
n=2×104 against an adversarial block-Prolonger). If Lemma 1 is right — and it is — the prior "universal counter" claim was wrong. This doesn't affect the correctness of the new proof; it's a positive finding that the new analysis debunks a stalled belief in the prior work.

Point-by-point audit
1. Lemma 1 (refined Chebyshev). Verdict: correct.
The product-of-primes step ∏3≤p≤Qp≤nj∏i<jqi\prod_{3 \le p \le Q} p \le n^j \prod_{i<j} q_i
∏3≤p≤Q​p≤nj∏i<j​qi​ is fine because any prime that is illegal at turn jj
j either equals a previous qiq_i
qi​ or divides at least one of Prolonger's jj
j moves — and lcm(Prolonger’s moves)≤∏moves≤nj\text{lcm}(\text{Prolonger's moves}) \le \prod \text{moves} \le n^j
lcm(Prolonger’s moves)≤∏moves≤nj. Note this is robust to Prolonger playing block-products: one move can carry many prime divisors, but they contribute to the njn^j
nj size budget.

The uniformity of CC
C across nn
n and i≤Ki \le K
i≤K works because log⁡(log⁡n+log⁡i+Clog⁡log⁡n)=log⁡log⁡n+O(1)\log(\log n + \log i + C \log\log n) = \log\log n + O(1)
log(logn+logi+Cloglogn)=loglogn+O(1) uniformly in this range, giving ∑i<jlog⁡qi=jlog⁡j+O(jlog⁡log⁡n)\sum_{i<j} \log q_i = j\log j + O(j\log\log n)
∑i<j​logqi​=jlogj+O(jloglogn). Setting Q=(1+ε)j(log⁡n+log⁡j+Clog⁡log⁡n)Q = (1+\varepsilon) j (\log n + \log j + C\log\log n)
Q=(1+ε)j(logn+logj+Cloglogn) and invoking ϑ(Q)=(1+o(1))Q\vartheta(Q) = (1+o(1))Q
ϑ(Q)=(1+o(1))Q (PNT, uniform for Q→∞Q \to \infty
Q→∞), the inequality flips for CC
C larger than a specific constant depending only on ε\varepsilon
ε. The proof understates the care needed for the ε→0,λ→1\varepsilon \to 0, \lambda \to 1
ε→0,λ→1 limit — for small ε\varepsilon
ε the required nn
n threshold grows — but this is absorbed into o(1)o(1)
o(1).

One nit worth flagging: the inductive step uses ϑ(Q)∼Q\vartheta(Q) \sim Q
ϑ(Q)∼Q with QQ
Q possibly as large as ∼n\sim n
∼n (at j=Kj = K
j=K), so the PNT error term must be at most o(εQ)o(\varepsilon Q)
o(εQ). This is fine under standard PNT (Qexp⁡(−clog⁡Q)Q \exp(-c\sqrt{\log Q})
Qexp(−clogQ​)), but requires nn
n large as a function of ε\varepsilon
ε.

2. Lemma 2 (monotone replacement). Verdict: correct in spirit; contains an unstated distinctness requirement.
The core injection qa↦paqa \mapsto pa
qa↦pa is clean. Checking all four conditions: (i) pa<qa≤npa < qa \le n
pa<qa≤n ✓; (ii) papa
pa odd since aa
a odd ✓; (iii) (pa,R)=1(pa, R) = 1
(pa,R)=1 because (qa,R)=1(qa, R) = 1
(qa,R)=1 forces (a,R)=1(a, R) = 1
(a,R)=1 and p∉Rp \notin R
p∈/R ✓; (iv) injectivity trivial ✓. Inclusion-exclusion converts this to ∣SR∪{p}∣≤∣SR∪{q}∣|S_{R \cup \{p\}}| \le |S_{R \cup \{q\}}|
∣SR∪{p}​∣≤∣SR∪{q}​∣. Clean.

The gap is in the iterated application: the proof wants to replace {qJ+1,…,qK}\{q_{J+1}, \ldots, q_K\}
{qJ+1​,…,qK​} with {bJ+1,…,bK}\{b_{J+1}, \ldots, b_K\}
{bJ+1​,…,bK​} coordinate-wise via one-at-a-time swaps. When swapping qj→bjq_j \to b_j
qj​→bj​, Lemma 2 requires that bjb_j
bj​ is
not already in the current set (i.e., bj∉{qj+1,…,qK}b_j \notin \{q_{j+1}, \ldots, q_K\}
bj​∈/{qj+1​,…,qK​} at that swap step). Since bj≈(1+2ε)qjb_j \approx (1+2\varepsilon) q_j
bj​≈(1+2ε)qj​ and qjq_j
qj​'s density on the log scale is similar, bjb_j
bj​ could coincide with some qiq_i
qi​ for i>ji > j
i>j.

Fix: this is repairable. The target band for bjb_j
bj​ is a window of multiplicative width ∼log⁡log⁡n/log⁡n\sim \log\log n / \log n
∼loglogn/logn, which contains ≫1\gg 1
≫1 primes by PNT. Choose bjb_j
bj​ to be any prime in the window that avoids {q1,…,qK}\{q_1, \ldots, q_K\}
{q1​,…,qK​} — possible since the band has ≫K/log⁡n\gg K / \log n
≫K/logn primes to spare. The proof should include this paragraph.

3. Log-scale measure convergence. Verdict: correct.
For bj=(λ+o(1))j(log⁡n+log⁡j)b_j = (\lambda + o(1)) j(\log n + \log j)
bj​=(λ+o(1))j(logn+logj) with j=nuj = n^u
j=nu, 1/bj=(1+o(1))/(λj(1+u)log⁡n)1/b_j = (1+o(1))/(\lambda j (1+u) \log n)
1/bj​=(1+o(1))/(λj(1+u)logn). Converting Riemann sum to integral via dj/(jlog⁡n)=dudj/(j \log n) = du
dj/(jlogn)=du gives ∑p∈B1/p→∫δ1du/(λ(1+u))\sum_{p \in B} 1/p \to \int_\delta^1 du/(\lambda(1+u))
∑p∈B​1/p→∫δ1​du/(λ(1+u)), which tends to (1/λ)log⁡(2/(1+δ))(1/\lambda)\log(2/(1+\delta))
(1/λ)log(2/(1+δ)). Endpoints: clean, no obstruction.

4. Finite inclusion-exclusion from p≥nδp \ge n^\delta
p≥nδ. Verdict: correct, and this is actually one of the proof's strongest moves.

M≤nM \le n
M≤n can have at most ⌊log⁡n/log⁡nδ⌋=⌊1/δ⌋\lfloor \log n / \log n^\delta \rfloor = \lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor
⌊logn/lognδ⌋=⌊1/δ⌋ prime factors from Bλ,δB_{\lambda,\delta}
Bλ,δ​. So X≤⌊1/δ⌋X \le \lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor
X≤⌊1/δ⌋ almost surely, and P(X=0)=∑r=0⌊1/δ⌋(−1)rE(Xr)\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = \sum_{r=0}^{\lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor} (-1)^r \mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
P(X=0)=∑r=0⌊1/δ⌋​(−1)rE(rX​) is an
identity, not a truncation — no Bonferroni inequality needed. This is what lets the proof go past the 5/165/16
5/16 and e−1/2/2e^{-1/2}/2
e−1/2/2 barriers cleanly: you get equality at the P(X=0)\mathbb{P}(X=0)
P(X=0) step, and all subsequent work is bounding E(Xr)\mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
E(rX​).

5. Factorial moment convergence. Verdict: correct, with the uniformity question having a clean answer.
E(Xr)=∑p1<⋯<pr∈Bλ,δ, p1⋯pr≤n(1/(p1⋯pr))+O(1/n⋅#valid subsets)\mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r} = \sum_{p_1 < \cdots < p_r \in B_{\lambda,\delta},\, p_1 \cdots p_r \le n} (1/(p_1 \cdots p_r)) + O(1/n \cdot \#\text{valid subsets})
E(rX​)=∑p1​<⋯<pr​∈Bλ,δ​,p1​⋯pr​≤n​(1/(p1​⋯pr​))+O(1/n⋅#valid subsets). The number of valid rr
r-subsets is bounded by the count of integers ≤n\le n
≤n with ≥r\ge r
≥r distinct prime factors in BB
B, which by Landau is O(n(log⁡log⁡n)r−1/log⁡n)O(n (\log\log n)^{r-1}/\log n)
O(n(loglogn)r−1/logn). Multiplying by O(1/n)O(1/n)
O(1/n): total error per rr
r is O((log⁡log⁡n)r−1/log⁡n)=o(1)O((\log\log n)^{r-1}/\log n) = o(1)
O((loglogn)r−1/logn)=o(1).

Uniformity: rr
r ranges over {0,1,…,⌊1/δ⌋}\{0, 1, \ldots, \lfloor 1/\delta \rfloor\}
{0,1,…,⌊1/δ⌋} — a
finite set for each fixed δ\delta
δ. So pointwise o(1)o(1)
o(1) per rr
r combined with finiteness of the index set gives total o(1)o(1)
o(1) trivially. This is genuinely fine.

The translation p1⋯pr≤n⇔u1+⋯+ur≤1p_1 \cdots p_r \le n \Leftrightarrow u_1 + \cdots + u_r \le 1
p1​⋯pr​≤n⇔u1​+⋯+ur​≤1 has an o(1)o(1)
o(1) error band at the boundary, but Riemann-integrable simplex measure absorbs this.

6. Order of limits: n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞, δ↓0\delta \downarrow 0
δ↓0, λ↓1\lambda \downarrow 1
λ↓1. Verdict: correct.

Each Ir(δ)I_r^{(\delta)}
Ir(δ)​ is bounded by 1/r!1/r!
1/r! (simplex volume is 1/r!1/r!
1/r!, integrand ≤1\le 1
≤1), and ∑1/r!<∞\sum 1/r! < \infty
∑1/r!<∞, so dominated convergence applies for δ→0\delta \to 0
δ→0. Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
Vλ,δ​ is monotone-ish in both parameters in the regime of interest — my computation shows Vλ\mathcal{V}_\lambda
Vλ​ is monotone increasing in λ\lambda
λ, so λ↓1\lambda \downarrow 1
λ↓1 is the right direction and gives the infimum:

lambda = 1.00: V/2 = 0.2200145
lambda = 1.05: V/2 = 0.2306139
lambda = 1.10: V/2 = 0.2404644
lambda = 1.20: V/2 = 0.2582039
Note λ=1\lambda = 1
λ=1 itself is unreachable (Lemma 1 requires strict inequality), but the limit is. The stated order n→∞n \to \infty
n→∞ first, then δ,λ→\delta, \lambda \to
δ,λ→ boundary, is the correct one and commutes.

7. Numerical evaluation. Verdict: all terms correct, Leibniz convergence genuine.
I recomputed via recursive convolution on a 40,00140{,}001
40,001-point grid:

V=0.4400290378…\mathcal{V} = 0.4400290378\ldots
V=0.4400290378…, so κ=V/2=0.2200145190…\kappa = \mathcal{V}/2 = 0.2200145190\ldots
κ=V/2=0.2200145190… —
identical to the cross-reference's ρ≈0.2200145\rho \approx 0.2200145
ρ≈0.2200145 within my computed precision. The researcher's stated "0.22002" is just rounded display.

Leibniz-style convergence is genuine. The ratios Ir+1/IrI_{r+1}/I_r
Ir+1​/Ir​ are:

I_1/I_0 = 0.6931  (proven bound log 2/1 = 0.6931, tight)
I_2/I_1 = 0.2124  (bound log 2/2 = 0.3466)
I_3/I_2 = 0.1011  (bound log 2/3 = 0.2310)
I_4/I_3 = 0.0587  (bound log 2/4 = 0.1733)
Observed ratios are well below the proven bound Ir+1≤(log⁡2/(r+1))IrI_{r+1} \le (\log 2/(r+1)) I_r
Ir+1​≤(log2/(r+1))Ir​ (which follows from integrating out ur+1u_{r+1}
ur+1​ and using log⁡(2−∑ui)≤log⁡2\log(2 - \sum u_i) \le \log 2
log(2−∑ui​)≤log2). Alternating series tail after r=7r = 7
r=7 is <3×10−10< 3 \times 10^{-10}
<3×10−10.


Why this beats the heuristic barriers
Worth articulating, because the improvement isn't where one might expect:

Old 5/165/16
5/16:
 came from st≤1/2s_t \le 1/2
st​≤1/2 (the truncation choice, not a hard cap) and f2(1/2)=5/8f_2(1/2) = 5/8
f2​(1/2)=5/8 via second-order Bonferroni.

**Heuristic e−1/2/2≈0.303e^{-1/2}/2 \approx 0.303
e−1/2/2≈0.303:** assumed the *prime-reciprocal mass is 1/21/2
1/2* and used all-order Mertens ∏(1−1/q)≈e−∑1/q\prod(1-1/q) \approx e^{-\sum 1/q}
∏(1−1/q)≈e−∑1/q.

Refined Chebyshev + Mertens naive: if you plug s=log⁡2s = \log 2
s=log2 into e−s/2e^{-s}/2
e−s/2, you get 1/4=0.251/4 = 0.25
1/4=0.25.

**Actual V/2≈0.220\mathcal{V}/2 \approx 0.220
V/2≈0.220:** the improvement over 0.250.25
0.25 is *not* from larger ss
s (both estimates use s=log⁡2s = \log 2
s=log2). It's from the p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n constraint in the factorial moments, which makes the constrained IrI_r
Ir​ strictly smaller than the unconstrained (log⁡2)r/r!(\log 2)^r/r!
(log2)r/r! for r≥2r \ge 2
r≥2. Numerically: I2constrained=0.147I_2^{\text{constrained}} = 0.147
I2constrained​=0.147 vs (log⁡2)2/2=0.240(\log 2)^2/2 = 0.240
(log2)2/2=0.240 — a 39% reduction. This compounds in the alternating sum to move the final value from 1/21/2
1/2 to 0.440.44
0.44.


This is the real intellectual content of the improvement. The proof doesn't merely sharpen prior estimates; it captures a non-heuristic effect (failure of independence for large-prime pairs) that classical Mertens/Kubilius heuristics miss.
Lemma 1 vs. "universal block-product counter" — structural finding
The problem statement claims, under "Why sts_t
st​ is capped at 1/2 (universal block-product Prolonger counter)":


For every Shortener strategy, Prolonger has a response forcing Shortener's accessible prime-reciprocal mass to be at most 1/2+o(1)1/2 + o(1)
1/2+o(1).


Lemma 1, against that *same* smallest-legal-odd-prime Shortener, proves ∑j≤K1/qj≥(1−o(1))log⁡2≈0.693\sum_{j \le K} 1/q_j \ge (1-o(1)) \log 2 \approx 0.693
∑j≤K​1/qj​≥(1−o(1))log2≈0.693 **against every Prolonger strategy**. These are directly inconsistent.

My simulation (with a greedy block-product Prolonger) produces:
nn
n∑1/qj\sum 1/q_j
∑1/qj​10000.87250001.110200001.169
Far above 1/21/2
1/2, and consistent with growth to at least log⁡2\log 2
log2 (and in fact beyond, because my Prolonger wasn't playing optimally — an optimal Prolonger likely plays individual integers rather than wasteful block-products, letting Shortener reach still-smaller primes).

The block-product-counter claim in the problem setup is almost certainly an **overstatement of what the counter achieves**. A block-product Prolonger does block primes summing to ∼(1/2)log⁡log⁡n\sim (1/2)\log\log n
∼(1/2)loglogn of the *small-prime mass ≤n1/3\le n^{1/3}
≤n1/3*; the leap from there to "Shortener's total reciprocal mass ≤1/2\le 1/2
≤1/2" doesn't follow — Shortener still has primes in (n1/3,n](n^{1/3}, n]
(n1/3,n] available. Lemma 1 constructively refutes the cap.

This is good news for the researcher's proof — it doesn't depend on that counter, and in fact supplies the formal machinery that shows the counter's strongest form is wrong.
Literature connection
The technique is entirely classical in its ingredients:

**Factorial moments / Bonferroni**: the identity P(X=0)=∑r(−1)rE(Xr)\mathbb{P}(X=0) = \sum_r (-1)^r \mathbb{E}\binom{X}{r}
P(X=0)=∑r​(−1)rE(rX​) is standard inclusion-exclusion; truncation at even rr
r is Brun's pure sieve (see Kevin Ford's *Basic Sieve Methods and Applications*, Thm 1.5).

**Finite-support exactness** from primes ≥nδ\ge n^\delta
≥nδ: this is a known trick — it appears in treatments of the *fundamental lemma of sieve theory* whenever one sifts by primes whose logarithms have bounded ratio to log⁡n\log n
logn. The Kubilius model makes this rigorous under the name "sifting density."

**Log-scale du/(1+u)du/(1+u)
du/(1+u) measure**: this is where the computation becomes non-standard. The measure arises because the researcher sieves not by *all* primes in [nδ,n][n^\delta, n]
[nδ,n] (which has log-density 1/u1/u
1/u — leading to Dickman/Buchstab), but by a *thinned* sequence of rate 1/(λj(1+u)log⁡n)1/(\lambda j(1+u) \log n)
1/(λj(1+u)logn). The thinning is dictated by the Chebyshev bound on Shortener's actual reachable primes — it is not a classical sieve setup.


**The constant V=∑(−1)rIr\mathcal{V} = \sum (-1)^r I_r
V=∑(−1)rIr​ with Ir=(1/r!)∫Δr∏du/(1+u)I_r = (1/r!) \int_{\Delta_r} \prod du/(1+u)
Ir​=(1/r!)∫Δr​​∏du/(1+u) does not appear in the standard references I can find** (Tenenbaum's *Introduction*, Friedlander-Iwaniec *Opera de Cribro*, Halberstam-Richert, Ford's notes). It is closely related in form to Buchstab and Dickman, but has a different underlying density. The Laplace transform of the related function F(t)=∑(−1)rJr(t)/r!F(t) = \sum(-1)^r J_r(t)/r!
F(t)=∑(−1)rJr​(t)/r! is (1/s)exp⁡(−esE1(s))(1/s)\exp(-e^s E_1(s))
(1/s)exp(−esE1​(s)) — not a standard special function. So the numerical value 0.4400290…0.4400290\ldots
0.4400290… appears to be genuinely new in this specific form, even though the techniques are textbook.

The cross-reference note's F/2≈0.2200145F/2 \approx 0.2200145
F/2≈0.2200145 and the researcher's V/2≈0.2200145\mathcal{V}/2 \approx 0.2200145
V/2≈0.2200145 matching to 7 significant figures is strong evidence both derivations compute the same true value. If the "different technique" referred to is direct infinite-order inclusion-exclusion after substituting ri=(1+o(1))yir_i = (1+o(1)) y_i
ri​=(1+o(1))yi​ to model primes, then it's essentially the same sieve computation packaged differently — and the pressure-test concerns I raise (items 2 and the block-counter tension) carry over, since both derivations depend on a Lemma-1-style prefix bound and a Lemma-2-style monotone replacement.

Summary of risks, ordered by severity

Lemma 2 distinctness (unstated assumption): The replacement sequence bjb_j
bj​ must avoid the set {qi}i≠j\{q_i\}_{i \ne j}
{qi​}i=j​ at each swap. PNT gives enough slack to choose bjb_j
bj​ accordingly, but the proof doesn't say so.
Verdict: fixable with one paragraph. The same gap affects any derivation that uses coordinate-wise monotone replacement.
Prolonger-strategy independence of Lemma 1 (hidden claim worth emphasizing): The bound qj≤(1+ε)j(log⁡n+log⁡j+O(log⁡log⁡n))q_j \le (1+\varepsilon) j(\log n + \log j + O(\log\log n))
qj​≤(1+ε)j(logn+logj+O(loglogn)) is universal in Prolonger's strategy, not just for "reasonable" Prolongers. This is the content of the inequality ∏p≤nj∏qi\prod p \le n^j \prod q_i
∏p≤nj∏qi​. The proof states this correctly but doesn't flag how strong a statement it is — in particular, it contradicts the block-product cap in the problem setup.

**The 5/16→0.303→0.2205/16 \to 0.303 \to 0.220
5/16→0.303→0.220 narrative** (presentation only, not a break): The proof's opening line says "the key point is that the crude s=1/2s = 1/2
s=1/2 prefix analysis loses information" and focuses on the ss
s-mass improvement. As I showed above, the real improvement is *not* from larger ss
s (both the naive e−log⁡2/2=1/4e^{-\log 2}/2 = 1/4
e−log2/2=1/4 and V/2\mathcal{V}/2
V/2 use s=log⁡2s = \log 2
s=log2) but from the p1⋯pr≤np_1 \cdots p_r \le n
p1​⋯pr​≤n constraint capturing non-independence. Framing it as "the logarithmic profile replaces constant density" is accurate but undersells where the beating-1/41/4
1/4 comes from.

Infimum vs limit in Vλ,δ\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta}
Vλ,δ​: λ=1\lambda = 1
λ=1 is unreachable, so the bound is Vλ,δ+o(1)\mathcal{V}_{\lambda,\delta} + o(1)
Vλ,δ​+o(1) for some λ>1\lambda > 1
λ>1, taking λ↓1\lambda \downarrow 1
λ↓1. The proof's prose is sloppy about whether V\mathcal{V}
V is attained or merely approached. It's approached. Since V/2\mathcal{V}/2
V/2 is a limiting constant, the final bound is L(n)≤(V/2+o(1))nL(n) \le (\mathcal{V}/2 + o(1))n
L(n)≤(V/2+o(1))n — which is what's claimed. No real issue, just needs a sentence.

Base case of Lemma 1 induction: the case j=1j = 1
j=1 uses log⁡j=0\log j = 0
logj=0, giving q1≤(1+ε)(log⁡n+Clog⁡log⁡n)q_1 \le (1+\varepsilon)(\log n + C\log\log n)
q1​≤(1+ε)(logn+Cloglogn). The PNT-level step ϑ(Q)∼Q\vartheta(Q) \sim Q
ϑ(Q)∼Q requires Q→∞Q \to \infty
Q→∞, which is satisfied since log⁡n→∞\log n \to \infty
logn→∞. Fine, but the researcher could make this explicit.


What would definitively break the proof
None of the pressure-test items do. A genuine break would require either:

An error in Lemma 1's universal bound (I've checked carefully, I don't see one; the simulation agrees), or
A non-PNT-resolvable obstacle in the bjb_j
bj​ construction (PNT gives the necessary density), or

A failure of the finite inclusion-exclusion (which is an exact identity, not an approximation, so can't fail), or
Game-theoretic subtlety — e.g., Shortener not being able to complete KK
K prefix moves because the game ends early. This I checked: if ∣A∣<2K|A| < 2K
∣A∣<2K then L(n)=o(n)L(n) = o(n)
L(n)=o(n) trivially, and if ∣A∣≥2K|A| \ge 2K
∣A∣≥2K Lemma 1 applies. No gap.


Subject to fixing the Lemma 2 distinctness paragraph, the 0.220020.22002
0.22002 bound stands.
 The technique is sound, the numerics are verified to 10−1010^{-10}
10−10, and the agreement with an independent derivation to 7 figures is strong evidence of correctness.
