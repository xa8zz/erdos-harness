  Erdős Problem 872: Primitive-set saturation game
  ------------------------------------------------
  Two players (Long, Short) alternately pick distinct integers from {2, ..., n}
  into a shared set A subject to the primitive-set rule: no element of A divides
  another. The game ends when no further legal move exists. Long maximizes |A|,
  Short minimizes |A|.

  Define:
    sat_L(n) := game length under optimal Long, optimal Short, Long moves first.
    sat_S(n) := game length under optimal Long, optimal Short, Short moves first.

  Conjectures and bounds (Phase 3, aligned with Buddhdev manuscript Apr 2026 and
  the erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/872 community state of the art, 22 May 2026):

  Community notation: L(n) := sat_L n (Prolonger-first variant). Erdős's weak
  conjecture is
    (WeakErdos)   ∃ ε > 0. ∀ n sufficiently large.  L(n) ≥ ε · n.

  Current state of the art (unconditional):
    (LowerBound)  L(n) ≥ (1/8 − o(1)) · n · log log n / log n   (Buddhdev Thm 1.2)
    (UpperBound)  L(n) ≤ (W_4 / 2 + o(1)) · n  <  0.19 · n      (Buddhdev Thm 1.1)

  Conditional improvement target:
    (T2)  L(n) ≥ c_δ · n · (log log n)^2 / log n  (Buddhdev Thm 4.7, conditional
                                                  on the restricted safe-edge
                                                  hypothesis Def. 4.5).

  Our active goal: prove the restricted safe-edge hypothesis for the strategy-
  generated state subspace Σ_T2 of the rank-3 slot hypergraph G(n, δ), making T2
  unconditional. See gpt55_prompt.md for the precise statement.

  The Short-first variant sat_S satisfies an independent observation (not the
  Erdős problem itself, but useful as a separate finite-combinatorial fact):
    (SatS)  ∃ C : ℕ. ∀ n ≥ 4.  sat_S n ≤ Nat.primeCounter n + C
  Empirically sat_S(n) − π(n) ∈ {0, 1, 2} for n ∈ [4, 78] (CP-SAT + explicit
  "Short plays smallest available prime" strategy).

/-- NOTE (Phase 3, 22 May 2026): the earlier theorem name `weak_conjecture_refuted`
    was based on a notation mistake. The Erdős weak conjecture is about
    `satL n` (Prolonger-first), not `satS n`. The community lower bound
    `satL n ≥ (1/8 - o(1)) n loglog n / log n` (Buddhdev Thm 1.2) is unconditional,
    while `satL n ≤ 0.19 n` (Buddhdev Thm 1.1) is also unconditional. The weak
    conjecture `satL n ≥ ε n` remains open.

    The result below is the (technically true but irrelevant-to-Erdős)
    refutation of a Short-first analogue, not the Erdős conjecture itself. -/
